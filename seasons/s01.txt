[Dramatic instrumental music.] BILLY: The captain of the Astral Queen wants you to know he's got 1,500 prisoners under heavy guard. Tell him I want daily reports on the well-being of his prisoners. The President has given me a direct order. ADAMA: We're in the middle of a war and you're taking orders from a schoolteacher? HELO: Don't suppose there's a Plan B? BOOMER: Plans B, C, D, E are the same as A. Get off the planet and get back to the ship. ROSLIN: How much water did we lose? Almost 60% of total potable water reserves. If we don't find new supplies they'll run out of water in two days. [Microphone screeching.] GAETA: [Over PA.] Reveille, morning stations aboard Battlestar Galactica. All hands report to your stations. [Tigh grunting and groaning.] [Sighing.] TIGH: So, what do we have? TYROL: Good news, Colonel. We scouted the ice moon. Found an entire subsurface ocean. We've got reports and video for you. TIGH: Not exactly Caprica Beach down there, Chief? No, sir. We've registered temperatures venting of methane and C02. It's gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir. Cheer up. You know how lucky we are we found this ugly rock? Water riots breaking out all over the fleet. Civilians. TIGH: Whiney civie cry-babies can't stand less than a hot shower every day. TYROL: Yes, sir. Even Galactica's down to 10,000 JPs of water. TIGH: Ever see a man die of dehydration? TYROL: No, sir. Let's hope you never do. It isn't pretty. So, where were we? We drilled 23 core samples. We can't drink salt water! No, sir. That's why I had Cally test the ice. Well, there you go. Pure water. Couple of lemons, we could make lemonade. TYROL: Yes, sir. We'll have to melt the ice before we transport it up to the ship. What's that gonna take? High-capacity heater expansion tanks, D-25 plasma torches - Myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps. - Sounds like a lot of manpower. Ideally 1,000 men, sir. One thousand men? And where're they gonna come from? Slave labour. They are criminals. They've been sentenced to hard labour. And this is very hard labour. Not to mention physically dangerous. This is not for civilians, but APOLLO: Their ship wasn't designed for long-term incarceration. APOLLO: These men have been stuck in cramped cells for weeks now. They might even prefer to get out. Do something, even if it is dangerous. If they volunteer. But these aren't slaves and I will not have them treated as such. No. We could offer incentives. APOLLO: Points towards earning freedom. ADAMA: Excuse me. You wanna start releasing hardened criminals into the fleet? Sir, these men were on their way to Caprica for parole hearings which at least implies they may be ready for release. - Make it happen, Captain. - Yes, sir. To address Commander Adama's concerns, I'd like you to go along and set up a screening procedure to weed out the hardened criminals. I would like to have a representative from Galactica who will report directly to me about security issues. How about D? BILLY: Second Class Petty Officer Dualla. ADAMA: I know who she is. I'm not sure she's conversant with the technical details. She'll be fine, but we should send someone from ground crew who'll make sure the chosen men know to use the equipment. - Agreed. - I have to get to the CIC. Excuse me. BILLY: Madam President? The doctor. ROSLIN: Excuse me? BILLY: The doctor? Commander, do you have a ship's doctor aboard Galactica? - Maj. Cottle. Is there something wrong? - No, nothing urgent. Allergies. He's out on the fleet checking medical conditions. ADAMA: I'll tell him that you want to see him. ROSLIN: Thanks. Petty Officer Dualla. Conversant in technical details. Thinking entirely of the mission. Something on your mind, Captain? I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say. I have nothing to say to the personal representative of the President. I'm still Galactica's lead pilot. I have nothing to say to him, either. Every man has to decide for themselves which side they're on. I didn't know we were picking sides. [Sombre instrumental music.] That's why you haven't picked one yet. [lntense instrumental music.] WILKENS: I'm a bus driver, not a warden. APOLLO: How many total? WILKENS: 1,500. WILKENS: They don't give me their files or their names. WILKENS: Hell, they're just numbers. APOLLO: Thanks, Wilkens. All right. They're all yours. [PA system beeping.] [Tense instrumental music.] [Apollo clears throat.] I'm Capt. Lee Adama, personal representative of the President. We're in a crisis. Thousands of us are on the verge of dying from dehydration. The good news is we have found water. The bad news is, it's located on a moon with harsh environmental conditions. We need 1,000 able-bodied men to help us get that water. President Roslin feels that you represent our best chance. She also recognises that you are not slaves. Any man who volunteers to help us during this emergency will earn "freedom points" which can be applied toward earning his release. We're offering you a chance for a new beginning. Whoever is interested, please just step out of your cell. [Electronic buzzing.] [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Slow footsteps.] ZAREK: Thank you for your offer. We respectfully decline. PRISONER: Zarek! Oh, my God, that's Tom Zarek. The terrorist? PRISONERS: [Chanting.] Zarek! [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] [Theme music.] WILKENS: So who the hell is Tom Zarek? BILLY: He's a freedom fighter. - He's a prisoner of conscience. - He's a butcher. His colony was exploited by the other 11 for centuries. His people were marginalised, brutalised I'm from Saggitaron, and that man doesn't speak for all of us. He blew up a government building, there's no excuse for that. Captain, I've been watching the clock and if we won't get any help, we should move on. Zarek's got the prisoners united. Let's go through Zarek. [lntense instrumental music.] HELO: Hello? Anybody out there? Anybody wanna help two stranded pilots? HELO: That's what I hate about big cities. No one will help you. BOOMER: No more shouting. You're making me nervous. Feel like I'm in a movie. - At least it stopped raining. - For now. [Tense instrumental music.] Where is everyone? Some are dead. In their beds, at their desks. Ones who weren't killed outright probably ran into the hills. Won't do any good. - Guess I'm getting a little - Depressing? Morbid? Sorry. Been here longer than you. Wish I could say it gets easier. [Loud banging.] [Squeaking.] BOOMER: There's more. HELO: Boomer, you might not wanna Frakking rats. Let's go. Come on. Let's find a hospital, score some anti-radiation meds, okay? We've only got two days' worth left. Sharon, we've made it this far. We're gonna make it all the way. - Right. - Damn straight, all the way. We're doing good, real good. I guess someone must be watching out for us. DORAL: She's good. - So far. - Jealous? [lntense instrumental music.] NO. 6: This all makes me makes so sad. DORAL: They would've destroyed themselves anyway. They deserve what they got. We're the children of humanity. That makes them our parents, in a sense. True. But parents have to die. It's the only way children come into their own. [Cell door opening.] [Zarek sighs.] No, that's not necessary. I'd like to talk to you. Guard. Prisoner 893893 requests permission to speak with his visitor. SEABORNE: Granted. We're not allowed to speak unless asked a direct question. And you didn't ask me a direct question. ZAREK: You've never been in a prison before, have you, Captain? APOLLO: No. ZAREK: You're fortunate. - May I sit down? - Yes, of course. [Cell door shuts.] [Tense instrumental music.] APOLLO: We need these men of yours to help us. They're not my men. They belong to you. I belong to you. You own us. You're the master, we're the slaves. [Tense instrumental music continues.] APOLLO: You're clearly a man of principle. APOLLO: I respect that. ZAREK: Really? The things you've stood for over the years, the book you wrote. The book that had to be smuggled out of labour camp because stumps aren't allowed freedom of expression? I read it. In college. Thought it was radical, challenging. Made me question some things I'd accepted before without thinking. Nice to hear I'm a big hit on campus. You weren't, the book was banned. I read it anyway. Point is, I understand where you're coming from. But I don't think you understand how critical the situation is out there. People are gonna start dying. Hey, Starke. It's time for your break. BILLY: How can you say that? DUALLA: It's the truth. Zarek and the SFM, they don't care about justice. BILLY: His people, your people have been exploited. - You can't tell me about my people. - I'm not telling you about your people. All I want, the President wants is to offer you a chance to earn your freedom. Now you've said the truth: freedom is earned. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] Stay where you are, Captain. It'll all be over soon. [Electronic beeping.] SEABORNE: Nobody try anything! Back up! [Prisoners yelling.] [Prisoner grunting.] SEABORNE: We've got the guards and the crew in separate cells in Block 7. Mason is looking after the hostages. ZAREK: Nice job. SEABORNE: Everything's under control. The men are organising exactly as planned. I knew I could count on you. [Cell lock clacking.] Stay frosty there, Billy. Everything's gonna be all right. I don't know about that. They don't wanna hurt us. That won't get them what they want. Which is what? - Lt. Thrace. Good to see you. - Good to see you, too. BALTAR: Really? STARBUCK: No. [Starbuck giggles.] [Sympathetically.] Oh. - I wonder if she's a real blonde. - I doubt it. Now, one of you has been coming in a little hot lately. A little too hot. A little I don't know. He's burning up the deck with his skids because he can't pull back on the throttle. Who is the speed demon, my prince? Flat-Top, sir. [Pilots chuckling.] STARBUCK: Flat-Top. You got a need for speed, do you? Can't wait to get back to the Big G and the loving embrace of your fellow pilots? Or maybe you have a hot date with your right hand. It never gets a headache. Tell you what, Flat-Top, you come in too hot today you may have to start using your left. [Pilots exclaiming.] All right. You've been fun, you've been a great audience. Dismissed. [Pilots chattering.] TIGH: There's no smoking in the ready room. STARBUCK: My room, my rules, sir. - Where's your mummy? - Dead. Where's yours? - I'm looking for Boomer. - 1400. Boomer's in the tool room. A pilot blows his landings and you make a joke out of it? Screaming at people doesn't always get the best results, sir. I learned that at officer candidate school. You are right on the edge, Thrace. Careful you don't fall off. Speaking of falling off [Starbuck sniffs.] glad to see you've found a way to quench your thirst. [Tense instrumental music.] They won't negotiate while you're holding hostages. - I don't wanna negotiate. - Then what do you want? To be treated like men, not animals. - Finally have something to bargain with. - So what happens now? - We're gonna talk. - What about? Your father. - Is this a Monclair original? - Yes. BALTAR: Fantastic. ADAMA: Would you like some water? Yes, thank you. I'm not a collector myself, but I I am familiar with his work, and may I say you really do have an excellent eye for art. Thank you. [Tense instrumental music.] - Where's my Cylon detector, Doctor? - Oh, that. Yes, it's taking longer than expected, unfortunately. What's the hang-up? It's not working this time, Gaius. He can see right through you. There are a number of obstacles none of them insurmountable, but they do tend to slow us down. For a start, the lack of proper facilities. The water shortage, of course. The water shortage, not to mention ADAMA: Cut the BS. You said you had a way of detecting human from Cylon. Do you or don't you? [Tense instrumental music continues.] - I don't. - What? I don't think that I'm the man for this job. BALTAR: I'm not cut out for this kind of work. - You have to do this. - Why do I keep putting it off? It's my subconscious telling me that I'm not the man for this job, please. Listen to me. If you don't tell him what he wants to hear he's going to find you out. And when he does, they're going to tear your head off and throw your body out of an air lock! Pardon me. I haven't had much sleep recently, so [Adama sighs.] Unfortunately, Doctor, for both of us you're the last man we have. So what's the game plan, Doc? [Tense instrumental music.] This is what you say: "Commander, the truth is, there is one way." - Say it! - Commander, the truth is there is one way. [Repeating after No. 6.] I didn't wanna have to ask you for this but what I really need to complete the project is a nuclear warhead. That how you got to be the "personal representative of the President?" ZAREK: Because of your father? APOLLO: Hardly. [Zarek scoffs.] So, they don't get along, Adama and Roslin? They have their differences. But not when it comes to dealing with terrorists. I thought you said you respected me. Read my book. That was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking. Always better when the oppressed don't fight back, isn't it? A warhead? NO. 6: Technically, I need the plutonium inside. Technically, I need the plutonium inside. Figure out the rest for yourself. [Baltar sniffling.] As you may know, the Cylons are susceptible to certain kinds of radiation and by taking the plutonium and embedding it in a carbon nanotube matrix and it really is that simple I can construct a filter that will preferentially ionise synthetic molecules and thus deliver to you your Cylons. We have five warheads left aboard this ship. ADAMA: We may need them. BALTAR: Yes, of course. If you really think that this project has a low priority then you're totally within your bounds to [Tense instrumental music continues.] You'll get your warhead. Good boy. Thank you, Commander. TYROL: Look, the master-at-arms has been over every inch of that locker. She's come up with nothing. BOOMER: So they've got no idea who took those six G-4 charges - or who put that detonator in - Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it, okay? [Tigh grunts.] I need to speak with the Lieutenant, alone. [Door shuts.] You don't honestly think you've been fooling everyone, do you? I know. The old man knows. TIGH: Hell, the whole ship knows about you and the Chief. It stops. Now. Sir, the Chief and I are just friends. When the ship was being decommissioned, we let it go. Hell, we let people get away with murder. That was then and this is now. We're at war, this is a combat unit and you're his superior officer. Put a stop to it. That's an order. Yes, sir. GAETA: [Over PA.] Attention. Pass the word for Col. Tigh. Col. Tigh, please report to the CIC. [Door shuts.] ZAREK: [On radio.] The crew are my prisoners. They will not be harmed. ADAMA: Are you recording this? GAETA: Yes, sir. TIGH: What's this? ADAMA: Trouble. ZAREK: [On radio.] But I have two conditions before I release my captives. First, the government which controls our fate is illegal and illegitimate and it must submit to the will of the people. I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers. Second, I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership. And a new government that represents all of the people. These demands are made not for me or the former slaves held on this ship but for you, the people, the survivors of the holocaust and the children of humanity's future. I am Tom Zarek and this is the first day of the new era. - We've jammed his transmissions. - A little bit late for that. - Every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast. - It doesn't matter. It does matter. He's trying to bring down the government. ADAMA: No one'll take it seriously. You have something to learn when it comes to public opinion, Commander. Tom Zarek is a name with weight. He's a very sympathetic figure. A legend, almost. Twenty years in prison over a matter of principle. He's a criminal and a terrorist. People won't give him credence. ROSLIN: Don't be so sure, Commander. Rebellions are contagious. People are already rioting over the water crisis. We can't afford to destabilise this government right now. ADAMA: I agree. ROSLIN: When are you going in? I assumed you were gonna talk to him first. - We don't negotiate with terrorists. - I said talk. There's nothing to talk about. What he wants, I can't give him. We're not ready yet. Talking to Zarek gives us a little bit more time. That's what he wants, legitimacy. He wants to be recognised. He wants his crimes validated. I watched President Adar offer him a full pardon if he'd apologise and give up violence as a means of political change. He refused. [Sombre instrumental music.] - No commitments. No deals. - I'll let you know what happens. Three assault teams: Alpha, Bravo, Constellation. We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut through the hull here, here and here without being seen. Once we're inside, Alpha takes What's this "we" crap? - I'm going, sir. - Like hell. We have a few marines left on Galactica. - Let them handle it, Starbuck. - They don't have a sniper. With all due respect, I'm the best shot in or out of the cockpit. She's right. For once. Wonders never cease. All right, you're going in. You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take it. I wanna control that ship immediately. - And I want all the hostages alive. - Yes, sir. I don't even know how I drew this detail. - President thought you'd be valuable. - President doesn't know who I am. I told her. Sorry. On the other hand, it's nice to get out of the CIC. Break up the day, meet new people. Yeah. [Tense instrumental music.] MASON: You're not asleep. CALLY: Not anymore. MASON: Is that your way of telling us you're not scared? No, it's my way of telling you I'm tired. - You don't know what tired is. - Right. Don't! Don't mock me, little girl. I'm not mocking you. MASON: Tom and I, we go way back. Long time. If you know what's good for you, you'll be nice to me. [Pilots chattering.] Frequent wireless contact. TIGH: Keep us informed all the way. STARBUCK: Yes, sir. Good hunting. [Engines whining.] Who voted for Laura Roslin? You? Did you vote for her? - She was sworn in under the law. - The answer is, no one voted for her. And yet she's making decisions for all of us, deciding who lives and who dies. Is that democracy? Is that a free society? What is it you want from me? You want me to say she shouldn't be president? We need a government. - We need rules, we need a leader. - We need to be free men and women. If we're not free, then we're no different than Cylons. [Solemn instrumental music.] ZAREK: They call you Apollo. APOLLO: It's my call sign. Apollo's one of the gods. A lord of Kobol. You must be a very special man to be called a god. It's just a stupid nickname. Son of Zeus, good with the bow, god of the hunt and also a god of healing. Now, a god can reconcile those two opposing forces, but a mortal has to pick one side or the other. Have you picked a side, Apollo? Astral Queen, this is the Battlestar Galactica. Commander Adama wishes to speak to Mr. Zarek. - Please respond. - [Scoffs.] Zeus is calling. ZAREK: [On phone.] Commander Adama? Tom Zarek. How can I help you? First, I want to make sure that my people are unharmed. This is Apollo. I'm fine, so are the others. APOLLO: They're located on the lower ZAREK: That's enough, thank you. I'm glad to hear that no one's been hurt. That would have tragic consequences. - How long until you storm the ship? - I'm hoping that won't be necessary. I think that you and I can come up with some kind of understanding. This is not the only crisis that I'm dealing with. [Tense instrumental music.] The water shortage affects the entire fleet. Your men are on their way even as we speak. There's still time to work this out. Have the President step down and call for elections. That's not gonna happen. Then I look forward to meeting your men. [Phone clicks.] [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] - I knew you were faking. - I'm a light sleeper. - I don't think I have your respect. - I respect you. Get up. BILLY: Hey, what's going on? Hey! [Gun clicks.] - What are you doing? - Move. DUALLA: Where are you taking her? It's okay, Cally. You're gonna be okay. - They know where we are, Cally. - Capt. Adama! Hey! Capt. Adama! - They're willing to talk. - Sounded that way. [Tense instrumental music.] You want them to storm the ship. Soft seal. Pressurised. Eyes. That's it, isn't it? You don't want elections, you don't want your freedom. You want a bloodbath. You don't understand. Tom Zarek's been out of the headlines, out of the news forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell. Now he's got a chance to go out in a blaze of glory and he's gonna take it. Alpha One, we're in. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] Once Roslin uses Adama's soldiers to massacre the people on this ship prisoners and hostages alike people in the fleet will never forgive them. The entire government will collapse. - She can take care of herself. - You sure? She's been trained. We've all been trained in capture, it's [Cally screams.] You've been saying everything you're doing is for freedom. APOLLO: But the truth is it's all about Tom Zarek and his personal death wish. [Door opens.] SEABORNE: Tom. Something's up. MASON: Frakking bitch! ZAREK: That's Mason. What the hell. [Gunshot.] They're killing the hostages. Let's go. [Fast-paced instrumental music.] [Prisoner grunting.] [Tense instrumental music.] Constellation Team, set. [Mason screaming.] ZAREK: Mason! [Mason groaning.] ZAREK: Mason, what're you doing? - Bit my ear off. - Frak you! APOLLO: Open the door, she's been shot! You said they weren't animals. What do you call this? MASON: Twenty years I've been waiting! APOLLO: He's gonna kill her. Do something. You did this! You put him in a cage! You made him a monster! [Prisoner grunts.] [Tense instrumental music continues.] Bravo, set. You filthy bitch! You all deserve to die! [Cally sobbing.] You first. [Sobbing.] STARBUCK: All teams, sniper in position. - He's gonna do it. - You reap what you sow. You look at me. You see me! Look at me! [Seaborne grunting.] [Gun firing.] [Cally gasping.] [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] Come on, Lee. Take out the son of a bitch. [Apollo panting.] How about it, Tom? You still have a death wish? You ready to leave this world, right here, right now? - Yes. - Too bad. 'Cause this is what you're gonna do. APOLLO: You're gonna tell your men to help us get that water off the moon. APOLLO: They're gonna work for their points. APOLLO: And they're gonna earn their freedom. And then you're gonna get your elections. - What? - 'Cause you're right, Tom. You are right about democracy and consent of the people. [Tense instrumental music.] I believe in those things, and we're gonna have them. And you can have them, too. Or you can have this bullet. Your call. What are you doing, Lee? Come on. How do I know your father and the President will honour your word? You don't. You let the rest of the hostages go, we'll leave this ship in your hands. They try and come after you, you can still have your last stand. It's your choice. You reap what you sow. All right. ZAREK: Lower your weapons. ZAREK: Lower your weapons. PRISONER: Do what he says. Put them down. APOLLO: Back off. [Cally gasping.] APOLLO: Cally, you're gonna be okay. You just hang in there, you hear? STARBUCK: Got you. [Tense instrumental music.] [Apollo grunts.] [Gunshot.] [Guns clicking.] APOLLO: Cease fire! [Prisoners shouting.] PRISONER: Don't shoot! STARBUCK: All teams, hold positions. [Starbuck panting.] Frak. [Gasping.] - Thanks. - I need a medic here. God. I don't believe this. - It's unacceptable. - It's done. Prisoners have full control of the Astral Queen. We evac'ed all the guards and support personnel. It's their ship. - They're a threat to the entire fleet. - They've been disarmed. - The ship itself has no weapons. - The ship itself is a weapon! They're totally dependent on us for food, fuel and they've agreed to organise the workforce for the water detail on the moon. You've committed me to holding elections within a year. Madam President, with respect you're serving out the remainder of President Adar's term. When that term is up in seven months, the law says there's an election. I only committed you to obeying the law. - You were not authorised to make any deal. - You sound like a lawyer. I swore an oath to defend the articles. The articles say there's an election in seven months. If you're saying the law's out, then I'm not a captain, you're not a commander and you are not the president. And I don't owe either of you a damned explanation for anything. He's your son. He's your advisor. An election. I guess you finally picked your side. ADAMA: Madam President. [Entrance opens and shuts.] [Door shuts.] [Starbuck clears throat.] What the hell is this? Water? Bet your ass. There's plenty more where that came from. I have my flaws, too. The difference is, my flaws are personal, yours are professional. [Starbuck chokes.] Thank you, Lieutenant. That'll be all. [Sombre instrumental music.] [Door shuts.] [Sighs.] Specialist Lazy, how are you feeling? Must be nice lying around, doing nothing, as usual. Sorry, Chief. I didn't think you'd find me here. TYROL: I am so on to you. SOCINUS: Cally, is it true? SOCINUS: You really bite that guy's ear off? CALLY: He's lucky that's all I bit off. [Tyrol laughs.] That's my girl. [Knocking on door.] - I'm sorry, I can come back. - No, it's all right. Come on in. I just wanted to say goodbye before I head back to Galactica. And to tell you I hope you understand, I wasn't being disloyal, Madam President. I understand. You're upholding the law. I admire it. I believe in you. In what you're doing. And for what it's worth, seven months from now, you'll have my vote. Could you sit? There's something I need to tell you. The truth is, I might not be here in seven months. - Are you planning a vacation? - I wish. I told your father that I [Clears throat.] had allergies, but I have cancer. ROSLIN: I found out the morning of the attack. [Apollo sighs.] I'm so sorry, Madam President. I don't know what to say. ROSLIN: I understand. I'm going to fight this, but there is a great need for secrecy. Of course. [Sombre instrumental music.] Whether or not I survive this illness it is of great importance to me that there's a future for the people. And I fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope. So this has to stay between you and me. - You can count on me. - I know I can. You're Capt. Apollo. [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] STARBUCK: Like my new toy? It's my very own Cylon Raider. Boy, when you take a souvenir, you don't screw around. Congratulations, Doctor. You've just uncovered your very first Cylon. She probably doesn't know. If something happened to you I wouldn't know how to deal with it. I feel the same way. BOOMER: I'm a Cylon. Helo, come with me. Helo. Helo, come with me! ADAMA: New piece of equipment that just appeared in CIC. OFFICER: He had this when we found him. Send it to Galactica. The lab can look at it. It's a Cylon device. I'll continue to take the Chamalla. It has other benefits. The hallucinations? You're going to find Kobol. Birthplace of us all. He says we're gonna find Kobol, and that it's gonna lead us to Earth. [Solemn instrumental music.] You all right? [Solemn instrumental music continues.] You all right? HELO: Stop! Don't come any closer. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] Just do it. STARBUCK: Oh, Lee! BOOMER: Oh, God. PA SYSTEM: Attention. Pass the word for Lt. Valerii. Lt. Valerii, report to the Ready Room for a pre-flight briefing. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] [Door closing.] You don't lose control. Thanks. No. You got to lose control. Let your instincts take over. I thought we were just sparring. That's why you don't win. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] [Theme music.] [Mechanical whirring.] [Computer beeping.] ROSLIN: The doctor said I have six months at the outside. He said the cancer's moved into my lymphatic system. Aggressively moved in. I want you to hear me on this. You made a true believer out of me. Strange as that sounds, considering. But I believe. I know you're the one to lead us to our salvation. You are going to guide us to Earth. Then we better find it soon. - I'm out. - Like it's yours. - I picked up your five. - Frankly, I don't care. No, thank you, Doctor, I have a watch later. APOLLO: Crashdown hits. Davis? CRASHDOWN: What? CRASHDOWN: A little bit of this. A little bit of that. APOLLO: You guys always play this slow? CRASHDOWN: What did you say? CRASHDOWN: Don't distract me. APOLLO: Uncanny, I know. All right, 20, I call. And I raise you another 30. You can't compete with me. I always win. I'm sorry. NO. 6: Never seen you like this, Gaius. It's disappointing somehow. Common. So sorry to disappoint you. BALTAR: Disappoint you all. Thirty. And I call it. GAETA: What do you got, buddy? - Absolutely nothing. - Not bad, Crash. But not compared to that. DUALLA: Oh! APOLLO: You are APOLLO: No! DUALLA: You win every time. BALTAR: Sorry, I have to do it. BALTAR: Very sorry to disappoint you. STARBUCK: There's a card game GAETA: Hey. She's back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen. - How are you feeling? - Hey, Gaius. STARBUCK: Good. BALTAR: Mr. Vice President, if you don't mind, Lt. Thrace. Some level of decorum must be maintained, or is it a pirate ship you're running? No. Just a Battlestar, sir. GAETA: All right, let's play. Would you like to play? Maybe you'd like to sit next to Capt. Adama? Sure, Kara. Why don't you pull up a pew? No, that's okay, Lee. I've got things to do. BALTAR: Nothing's wild. Here we go. ROSLIN: All right, currency. While bartering will continue for the foreseeable future we do have a system in place now to take the economy back to a currency-based standard. NO. 6: Do you love her? Did you ROSLIN: Dr. Baltar if something should happen to me, it is vital that you comprehend and are familiar with the political structures beginning to fall into place here. - Do you understand this? - Answer me. Yes, of course I understand. My answer is no. No, I don't think I can handle this right now. BALTAR: The intricacies of the bureaucracy, I can't get my head around. This which, with all due respect, Madam President you have spent your entire political career learning to understand. More to the point how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly by a new thing it just astounds me. How did you seriously think I could cope with this kind of responsibility? NO. 6: I don't believe you. You're a genius, are you not? BALTAR: Well, quite frankly, I don't give a flying frack whether you believe me or not. All right? Because I've had it. I am tired of being pushed and prodded around like I'm some kind of toy. - I'm not your plaything. - Plaything? I don't work for you! And quite frankly, I don't have to sit here anymore and take this kind of abuse from either of you! You either! Either in here, either in there. Wherever it is, I don't need to take it. - I love you, Gaius. - Do me a favour. NO. 6: Yeah? I think perhaps you need a break from this. You're right. We need a break. I'd like to be alone if you don't mind. [Screams in pain.] NO. 6: How can you love her, Gaius? BALTAR: I don't. You can't lie to me, I know everything you know. That's lovely. Thank you. Did you Did you want something in particular this time? I thought you should know that it's not safe to remain on Galactica. What are you talking about? It's a surprise. Tell me, what is it? What is it? Is it a bomb? Another Cylon bomb, right? Is it an agent? Is a Cylon agent about to be activated? Tell me! BOOMER: Galactica, this is Raptor 1 preparing to jump to Sector 728. Let's hope we find some supplies out there. TIGH: Roger that. Good hunting out there. Crash, counter our spinner? Fuel drive's spun up and ready. Jump in five, four, three, two, one. CRASHDOWN: Whoa, baby! [System beeping.] Frack me! [Beeping continues.] Gaeta, the fracking idiot. You can't plan a jump that close to a planet. What if we jumped into it? It was great. It's fine. We made it. We're cool. CRASHDOWN: Are you seeing this? BOOMER: Yeah. [Solemn instrumental music.] CRASHDOWN: Oceans. Continents. No. Let me at this thing. Okay. Atmosphere reads as: Nitrogen, oxygen. Looks like enough CO2 for green leafy things. I'm getting excited here, Boomer. Boomer, this could be it. This could be the big one. This is the little planet that solves all our problems. Boomer? Do you think this is Earth? No. It's not Earth. It's more important than that. [Thunder rumbling.] Doesn't really work as well as before, huh? You know, I do get cold. There's some things you should know, Helo. Don't call me that. You're not even Sharon. You're not even human. So don't act like you know me because you don't! But I am Sharon! And that's part of what you need to understand! Sharon was a friend of mine! Whatever twisted thing you are, you are not Sharon! You got that? The only thing I want from you is a way off this fracked up world. That's it! APOLLO: Going hunting? I'm adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow. See if our boy can shoot anything with our ammo. So it's a boy now? STARBUCK: I changed my mind. APOLLO: You ever wonder why everyone calls it a she, but to you, it's a he? It's fascinating, Lee. You should write a paper. It's not really my scene. I'm not as smart as, say, Dr. Baltar. APOLLO: How is the Vice President, by the way? I don't know. Haven't seen him. So he's a "love them and leave them" kind of guy, I guess. I guess. APOLLO: Ships just pass in the night. STARBUCK: Yup. APOLLO: Didn't mean a thing. STARBUCK: Nope. Just bored. Looking for something to do. So fracking the Vice President seemed like a great way to waste some time. - You want something from me? - Not a thing. - I don't owe you anything. - You don't owe me anything. Because I'm just a CAG, and you're just a pilot. - Right. - A pilot that can't keep her pants on! Right. It's just like old times, Kara. Like when you got drunk and couldn't keep your hands off the major from wherever STARBUCK: God! Why did you do it, Kara? Just tell me why. Because I'm a screw-up, Lee. Try and keep that in mind. BILLY: Commander Adama is sending out another Raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet. BILLY: It appears to have suffered some sort of calamity but it could actually be inhabitable. BILLY: Aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface. BILLY: It was obviously abandoned long ago. ELOSHA: How old are the ruins? We won't know for sure until we send a ground team but the initial estimates have it on the order of approximately 2,000 years. That's around the time the 13 Tribes first left Kobol. ROSLIN: Let me see. Ruins? What ruins? This is an inhabited city. Look at the buildings. Buildings? ROSLIN: Look. ELOSHA: What did you see? Tell me, Laura. [Solemn instrumental music.] A dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it like spokes. With something around it like columns, like a forum, like the forum on Caprica, actually. ELOSHA: The forum in the opera house in the city of the gods on Kobol. This planet is Kobol. [Solemn instrumental music intensifies.] BILLY: Kobol like Kobol? ELOSHA: The birthplace of mankind. Where the gods and man lived in paradise. Until the exodus of the 13 Tribes. Madam President, what's going on? It's real. The scriptures, the myths, the prophecies. They're all real. So say we all. BALTAR: Hello, Lieutenant. BOOMER: Hey, Doc. This is a bad time, right? No. I'm just cleaning my gun. BOOMER: What's going on? I was going to ask you the same question. BALTAR: Actually, I was looking for Lt. Thrace. But sometimes, it's good to talk these things over. NO. 6: Deep down, she knows she's a Cylon. But her conscious mind won't accept it. Sometimes I have these dark thoughts. - What kind of dark thoughts? - Her model is weak. Always has been. But in the end, she'll carry out her mission. I don't know. But I'm afraid I'm going to hurt someone. I feel like I have to be stopped. She can't be stopped. She's a Cylon. NO. 6: You can't help her, Gaius. But you could probably sleep with her. That's what you want, right? I'm not sure why Sometimes we must embrace that which opens up for us. Embrace? Life can be a curse as well as a blessing. You will believe me when I tell you there are far worse things than death in this world. BOOMER: So you're saying BALTAR: No. What I say is meaningless. Listen to your heart. Embrace that which you know to be the right decision. [Solemn instrumental music.] [Gun fires.] You might be right. This may be Kobol. We should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet. The scriptures tell us that Kobol points the way to Earth. Organise a ground survey team. Three Raptors. I want a complete survey of the ruins immediately. APOLLO: Yes, sir. NO. 6: You should go. Remember what I said, Gaius? You don't want to be here when it happens. When what happens? What would happen if I go? In fact, I think I'm going to volunteer for the survey party. Your presence won't be necessary, Doctor. Thank you. I'm the Vice President of the colony, selected in my own right. And I feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary, Commander. As your chief science advisor, I have to analyse the samples the team brings, and it would be more efficient if I can gather the samples by myself. Unless you have any objection, Madam President. No objections. Thank you. We need to talk. Sure. You okay? BOOMER: What do you think? I think it's hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber. I didn't forget. Sharon, what's going on? I know things haven't been so great lately, but I wake up in the morning and I wonder who I am. I wake up and wonder if I'm going to hurt someone. Sharon, you need help. Not from you. You made that clear. BOOMER: I'm on my own. TYROL: No, you're not. Thanks for coming out, Chief. You're dismissed. So according to the scriptures if we had the arrow of Apollo, we could take it down to Kobol, and we could use it to open the tomb of Athena and find our way to Earth. I didn't know you were that religious. Neither did I. ROSLIN: Something wrong with that? ADAMA: No. It's just new. There is no Earth. You understand that. It would seem that we were wrong. Commander, just because you and I don't know where it is it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Madam President I am not trying to mock your faith, so please understand me. These stories about Kobol, gods the arrow of Apollo they're just stories, legends, myths. Don't let it blind you to the reality that we face. Reality is that the Cylon Raider has been successfully jump-tested. Reality is that Cylon technology obviously outstrips our own. And reality is there is a good chance the Raider can jump all the way back to Caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to Earth. ROSLIN: The real Earth. ADAMA: The Raider's a military asset. I won't use it to go chasing some mythical arrow. I'm sorry. HOT DOG: I say we find Kobol, count our blessings, and just stay there. PILOT: But the sacred scrolls say that this could guide us to Earth. Right? Okay. Cut the chatter. Raptors 2 and 3 on me. FTL's spun up and ready? Cally, hold onto your lunch. CRASHDOWN: Jump in ten nine, eight seven, six, five four, three two, one. ECO: Jump complete, gentlemen. Bring the nose down, we should see the planet directly ahead. What the hell is that? Oh, my God! [Fast-paced instrumental music.] Cartman! Get us out of here! CARTMAN: We got a fire in the turbine. Shutting it down! BALTAR: Put it down! CRASHDOWN: Out of the way! Come on! CRASHDOWN: Get out of the seat, Doc! TYROL: Everybody hang on! TYROL: Can you jump us out? No, the out drive's been hit. TYROL: Socinus, get on the horn and tell Raptor 2 to jump back to Galactica! Right now! Jump back to Galactica! [Screaming.] Jump back to Galactica, over. You are ordered to jump back to Galactica. [Fast-paced instrumental music continues.] Whenever they're within proximity of one another they send off a short IFF burst. Essentially, they are Cylon transponders programmed to identify themselves to any other Cylon transponder. - Damn nice work, Lieutenant. - That's very good. Now that we know what they are, I want to test one in the Raider. DUALLA: Draidus contact. Raptor 275, sir. Back early. Something's wrong. TYROL: What the hell are you doing? BALTAR: Oh, God! TYROL: Hang on! BALTAR: God! Oh, my God! TYROL: Do it! CRASHDOWN: Everybody hit the deck! [Screaming.] TYROL: I can't see! TYROL: Pull it up! Watch the hill! CRASHDOWN: Thanks for watching! How many people did we lose? APOLLO: Ten souls aboard Raptor 3. Raptor 1, last visual contact was seen under power flight heading toward the surface. We need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue. TIGH: Starbuck's working on a plan using the captured Raider to get a nuke into the base ship. - The Raider? - When did this happen? TIGH: About 19 minutes ago. She said she's working on the details and we'll have a report at 1400. ADAMA: Go talk to Starbuck right away. APOLLO: My pleasure. ADAMA: And report back to me. APOLLO: Yes, sir. Is there something to worry about, Madam President? Why do you ask that? - That look on your face. - Not now. STARBUCK: Take that out. The Chief said we need it, but I don't. APOLLO: Lt. Thrace, attention! I gave you a command. You will obey it. Attention! You do not take your harebrained ideas to the XO without going through me first. Do you understand? Yes, sir. At ease. So what's the plan? I'm putting an autopilot in the Raider. Jump him to the base ship. Engage the autopilot, punch out. Get picked up by a Raptor. STARBUCK: The Raider heads to the base ship. Except the transponder allows the Raider to approach. Nuke goes off. Boom, sir. Might work. Might get you killed. Would you miss me, sir? I need every pilot I have. Even the screw-ups. Captain. I'm really sorry. BILLY: If you do this, it could threaten everything we've accomplished. It may bring down the government and you don't have a right to risk that for a Go on. For a drug-induced vision of prophecy. I am well aware of that. But it would seem that the gods have a different plan. ROSLIN: Would you please get me Lt. Thrace? Can I get you some more water? Yes. Thanks. You can't be serious. ROSLIN: All of this has happened before and will happen again. That Cylon you interrogated, he quoted that bit of scripture. He also said that we would find Kobol and Kobol would show us the way, did he not? Yes, he did. ROSLIN: We have found Kobol. Do you believe in the gods, Lieutenant? Not that it's any of your business, but, yes, I believe. Lieutenant, I am not trying to put you on the defensive I would like you to think this through with me. If you believe in the gods then you believe in the cycle of time that we are all playing our parts in a story that is told again and again and again throughout eternity. That's the way I was raised. But that doesn't mean that my part in the story is to go off on some crazy-ass mission against orders. May I tell you the part of the story that it would seem I am playing? I am dying. - What? - I have terminal breast cancer. I have six months at the outside to live, and I have only told three people so I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself. Of course. Are you saying that you are The scripture tells us a dying leader lead humanity to the promised land. If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow I will show us the way. This is crazy. People keep using that word. It is crazy. Perhaps. That doesn't mean it isn't true. And it may be our only chance. Our only chance to find Earth. The old man is our last chance to find Earth. He knows where it is. He said so. You were there. The location is a secret. But he is going to take us there. [Sombre instrumental music.] Commander Adama has no idea where Earth is. He never did. He made it up in order to give people hope. - You're lying. - Go ask him. I will. [Sombre instrumental music continues.] STARBUCK: I need one more in-flight test for the autopilot and NAV systems before I jump for Kobol. ADAMA: Right. Can I ask you a question, boss? Shoot. How much longer till we reach Earth? It's hard to say. You got a guess? You know I don't like to guess. Are we getting closer? I'm sure we are. ADAMA: Good luck on the next test. Apollo. Starbuck. I'm ready over here. Okay, Starbuck. The board is green. Copy that. Powering up for the autopilot test. This is Starbuck, request permission to speak with Galactica actual. Starbuck wants to speak to you, sir. She's on a scrambled channel. Go ahead. I believed you. Believed in Earth. What are you doing, Starbuck? Bringing home the CAG, sir. We can talk about this. No, I don't think so. I want you to remember one thing. I do not regret anything that I did. Be sure that whatever you're going to do, you don't regret it later. Do you understand me? [lntense instrumental music.] I guess we'll find out. Commander, she's spinning up the Raider's FTL drive. TIGH: What? This is an autopilot test, what the hell is she doing? What are you doing, Kara? Galactica. Apollo. She just jumped away. Repeat. Starbuck and the Raider just jumped away. She wasn't scheduled for a jump test. Where the hell did she go? [Sombre instrumental music.] Home. [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica [Dramatic instrumental music.] I notice you're calling her Sharon now. NO. 6: She acts like them, thinks like them. NO. 6: She's one of them. DORAL: But she's one of us. BOOMER: We gotta go, now. We gotta travel fast. Even faster than before. ROSLIN: They found him in the storage compartment. He's another copy of the Cylon you know as Leoben. I'll send a team over to destroy it. Anything it says cannot be trusted. - Don't! - Adama is a Cylon. [Tense instrumental music.] Commander? Here's Dr. Baltar's report. And the President is waiting for you up in the core. Thank you. ADAMA: Clear the deck. ADAMA: Madame President, we are the proud owners of the universe's first, bona-fide Cylon detector. That is great news. Yeah. So, when do we begin? Dr. Baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible but there are some serious limitations. He can only do one person at a time, and verification takes hours. So who's going to go first? [Sighs.] The tests. Right. I think people in sensitive positions should go first. I completely agree. How about you? Excuse me? If you're a Cylon, I'd like to know. If I'm a Cylon, you're really screwed. [Giggling.] Seriously, I do think that you should go first. Show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top. Then maybe you should go first. All right, I'll go first. I think that's good. I do. PILOT: Bank on my advice. - They always do that? - No, they're just showing off. They know I'm in here. You date a special assistant to the President, word gets out. So this is officially a date? [Soft instrumental music.] Jury's still out. MAN: [Over PA system.] Observation deck has two minutes remaining. DUALLA: You could pull rank. You could tell them you're on special business for the President of the Colonies. Your boss pulls more weight around here than mine. - You can tell them Adama wants you to - Yeah, what? Wants me to what? I lost my train of thought. [Soft instrumental music continues.] How is he these days, by the way? - The old man? He's fine, I guess. - You guess? He's been acting kind of funny lately. Seems distracted or something. He's been making all these weird calls from his quarters. Super secret. - Probably a security thing. - They don't want me to log the calls, though. No trace file. Nothing. - And this just started? - A few days ago. Billy Keikeya, are you pumping me for information about the old man? DECKHAND: Time's up. - No. Of course not. - You are. - You are. You're a spy, that's what you are. - I was just asking a couple of questions. I hope you liked the answers. Because they're the last ones you're gonna get for a while. ROSLIN: What did you find out? Dualla couldn't put her finger on it but, yeah, she said he's been acting differently. I could see that myself. He was distracted and unfocused. What else? Some scrambled wireless calls he didn't want logged. She didn't know who he called or why. But none of this is damning evidence. BILLY: The calls could be security-related and his odd behaviour could be stress, pure and simple. - Exhaustion, paranoia - All right. It could be any of those things. ROSLIN: But what if it's not? Madame President, with all due respect I cannot believe we're actually entertaining the idea that Commander Adama has been somehow replaced by a Cylon duplicate. Oh, my gods, Billy I hope you're right. [Theme music.] Is suicide really a sin? NO. 6: A mortal one, I'm afraid. But it's not that bad, is it, Gaius? [Opera music playing.] BALTAR: Eleven hours to test each one for Cylon indicators. NO. 6: That'll take awhile. NO. 6: 60.1534 years. Now, let's figure in a few hours to sleep here and there. BALTAR: We'll call it an even 61, shall we? NO. 6: Sure. I prefer to kill myself. [Clears throat.] Commander Adama, are you a Cylon? BALTAR: Tune in tomorrow. NO. 6: It's hard being a genius. BALTAR: Yes. NO. 6: There should be some perks. BALTAR: Yes. [Opera music continues.] [Notebook thudding.] [Baltar's zipper opening.] [No. 6 moaning.] [No. 6 gasping.] [Moaning.] [Baltar moaning in pleasure.] STARBUCK: What's up, Doc? [Opera music stops.] Lt. Thrace, good to see you. I was just keeping up with the old exercises. [Comical instrumental music.] That should do me for today. [Baltar stuttering.] BALTAR: I feel all better. BALTAR: What brings you to the lab at this time of the night? STARBUCK: It's mid-afternoon. BALTAR: Yeah, it is. Crazy workload. I totally lose track of time. So, what can I do for you? You can zip up your fly. - So - My blood test. NO. 6: You're right about one thing, Gaius. There is something very intriguing about her. Very good. Very good. At least I did that much. [Sighs softly.] [Slow instrumental music.] Dradis, contact! - Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005. - Galactica, Apollo. - Action stations. - Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005. - Relative zero. - Close with enemy, destroy. Acknowledge. APOLLO: We're on it, Galactica. He jumped right in front of us. His mistake. - How many? - Single Raider. Looks like a recon patrol. Apollo and Beehive have them in their sight. TIGH: Where's the old man? DUALLA: He's not aboard. - Not aboard? Where the hell is he? - He left in a Raptor about an hour ago. DUALLA: No flight plan. TIGH: No flight plan? APOLLO: That's it. You set him up, I'll knock him down. [lntense instrumental music.] APOLLO: I winged him. Looks like I got his weapon systems. He jumped. He jumped away before we could zero him out. Damn it. Probably giving away our position to every Cylon base ship right now. Where in the hell is the old man? Order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures. Everyone rendezvous at the stand-by coordinates. Contact! Single Raider bearing 881 carom 247. Apollo, Galactica, Cylon Raider detected at 881 carom 24 APOLLO: Wait, I see him! Same Raider. TIGH: What? It's the same Raider. I can see the damage from before. It's behaving erratically. He jumped away again. Contact. Single Raider, same telltales. [lntense instrumental music continues.] - It's like he's just flying around in circles. - Wounded bird. Can't fly home. APOLLO: Galactica. We got him on Dradis, but he's pretty far out there. Take us three minutes to close to weapons range. No. This is our perfect chance to get some intel. Order Apollo to close with the Raider, but do not engage. Put a Raptor in the air. As long as that's flopping around out there tell them I want to suck in every electronic signal it makes. Sir. Colonel, Commander Adama's Raptor is requesting permission DUALLA: to enter the landing pattern. TIGH: Permission granted. TIGH: Stand down to Condition Two. DUALLA: Permission granted. TIGH: Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck. [Beeping.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] ADAMA: Permission to come aboard? TIGH: Granted. TIGH: Mind telling me where the hell you've been? Col. Tigh, allow me to present your wife. Ellen? HELO: That noise. I don't get it. I've blown Centurions away before. They've never sent an entire army after me. BOOMER: They're after me. HELO: Why you? While they were holding me, I overheard some things. HELO: What? BOOMER: Plans. Deployments. There's a big Cylon base at Delphi. A major hub. HELO: Delphi? Frakking bastards. The best place to try and grab a ship and get off this frakking planet. [Helo panting.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Dr. Gaius Baltar, Department of Cylon Detection how may I direct your call? ROSLIN: You're in a good mood. BALTAR: Madame President [Stuttering.] I'm sorry. I was expecting someone else. We haven't spoken in ages. Doctor, I'd like you to call me the moment Commander Adama's test is complete. Will you do that? Commander Adama cancelled his test a short time ago. - Why? - I don't know. He gave me another sample. He said it had priority. - Whose? - I'll just check. Some woman called Ellen. No surname. He dropped it off and left. Is there a problem? Dr. Baltar, I would like you to resume testing Commander Adama's blood sample immediately. Thank you. - I can't believe you're alive. - I can't believe it myself. [Ellen laughing.] Saul, I don't remember the last few weeks. ELLEN: It's weeks, right? TIGH: Right. You've been on the Rising Star all this time? ELLEN: I guess so. The last thing I remember is being on Picon. I was at the airport buying a ticket home and hearing something about the Cylons. And then just dreams, mostly dreams until a couple days ago. ELLEN: They tell me I was knocked out when the Cylons attacked the airport. And someone just picked me up and put me on the last flight out. Some saviour. I don't even know who. It's all right. You're here now. STARBUCK: It's like we found a treasure chest. One of the major issues we've been having with the Raider we captured is to figure the faster-than-light drive. This wounded bird is jumping all over the place out there. Yeah. And every time it jumps, it gives us more data that we can use. But what was it doing out there, and how long can it keep it up? The moment you have your FTL data, give me an update. Let's not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to. TYROL: Yes, sir. - You wanted to see me, sir? - Stay on it. You have dinner plans? - What? - Come on. ELLEN: I never thought I'd see you again. TIGH: Me neither. The things I said before, the things I did In the past? It's all in the past. - Start over? - Start over. [Soft instrumental music.] [Phone buzzing.] - I I can't. - Forget it I can't. I'm on duty. [Phone buzzing.] XO. Now? Understood. All right. Tell her I'm on my way. Girlfriend? - Official business. - Feels like old times. - I'd explain, but - It's classified. I'll be back as soon as I can. I'll be here, waiting. As soon as I can. You want to be very, very careful with what you just said. You're talking about a man I owe my life to, many times over. I know these are uncertain times and this has been a difficult transition for you. Excuse me, Colonel. I do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear, believe me. But I would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret. I need to know if you have seen anything suspicious - about his recent behaviour? - No. What about the fact that he left the Galactica without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return and at that very moment, a Cylon Raider jumped into view - and started acting strangely? - I know exactly where he was. ROSLIN: You do? TIGH: He was picking up my wife. Your wife? Turns out she's been unconscious aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack. ROSLIN: Oh, my gods! ROSLIN: That's fantastic. That's amazing. TIGH: Yes, it is. When Ellen stepped off that shuttle, I thought I was going to pass out. Ellen? - Your wife's name is Ellen? - Yes, it is. Ellen. Ellen Tigh. I'd very much like to meet your wife, Colonel. Resume the test on Ellen? No, it's no trouble at all. TIGH: Ellen? - Did you shut the door? - I already did. [Ellen laughing alluringly.] - Surprise. - Ambrosia? Where did you get this? [Whispering.] I have my ways. ELLEN: I thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration. [Laughing.] - We need to talk. - First things first. There. - Starting over. - Starting over. - I'm technically still on duty. - I think they can do without you for a day. TIGH: It doesn't really work that way. [Tigh moaning.] Starting over. [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Ellen laughing mischievously.] [Ellen and Tigh laughing.] [Soft instrumental music.] Sure, there's whining and complaining like you would expect but the people I talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic. That's good to hear. There are a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be President but they're just a tiny minority. Wonderful. Everyone is so truly grateful to all of you on Galactica. - You literally are our saviours. - We're just doing our jobs. You are so modest. [Tigh and Ellen chuckling.] He's always been that way. [Glasses clinking.] Lee, could I trouble you for a little more of this lovely Ambrosia? - Sure. - Thank you, dear. Bill, you must be so proud of your sons. Lee here has grown into such a handsome man. I can only imagine what Zak must look like now. You are the spitting image of your mother and I bet Zak takes just after his daddy. ADAMA: Zak passed away a couple of years ago. I'm sorry. How tragic, the death of a child. There's been so much death, so much pain. Sometimes it's completely overwhelming. I'm sure he was a beautiful boy. [Ellen sighs.] The Captain of the Rising Star was puzzled as to how you got on his ship. I know. I know some thoughtful soul just rescued me from almost certain death, and put me on the last flight out of Picon. - How lucky for us all. - Yes, indeed. The strange thing is no one can recall giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago. I know. It's a miracle I'm alive. [Ellen laughing.] APOLLO: I think I better clear some of these dishes. - You are so sweet. - Very good. My compliments to the chef. So, Bill, now the question on everyone's mind and I do mean everyone APOLLO: Sorry. ELLEN: It's okay. is where is Earth and when do we get there? - That's classified information. - That word again. Leave the man alone. ELLEN: Come on, if there are no privileges of being an XO's wife then what's the point? Bill, we're all family here. Come on. The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen. I'm sorry. Perhaps you don't know that the Cylons look like us now. That, yes, I knew that. It's recent news. Most people found out a few days ago. A thing like that would travel fast. Right? Any one of us could be a Cylon. [Soft instrumental music continues.] Boo! [Ellen and Tigh laughing hysterically.] Did you see the looks on their faces? - You are too easy. - Thank you so much for coming. It's been a wonderful evening. TIGH: Thought it would never end. I seemed to have lost one of my shoes. - I think it's right here. - Thank you. APOLLO: Here we are. - You look very, very happy. - That's because I am very happy. Thank you. [Both laughing.] - It was nice to see you again. - The pleasure's all mine. - Hope to see you soon. - I'm sure you will. [Comical instrumental music.] Hang on. Watch your step. - Good night. - Lovely dinner. TIGH: I've got her. ADAMA: Be careful. You actually think that woman is a Cylon? If she's not, then we're all in a lot of trouble. ELLEN: When did Bill become such a stick-in-the-mud? The man's a carving. He's one of those faces on a totem pole. She slept with more than half the fleet, while Saul was in space. Why the hell did he stay married to her? - It's obvious. He loves her deeply. - Blindly. Ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy - bring out this self-destructive streak in him. - Used to? HELO: Sharon, stop! I can't keep up. [Helo coughing.] [Panting.] BOOMER: Helo, come on. You can do it. Please. You have to get up. [Dramatic instrumental music.] BOOMER: There. Right there. [Helo coughing.] BOOMER: Turn your light off. We gotta find another way out of here. We're going. Why aren't you waiting? You keep going and going. - You never get tired. - It's adrenaline. I'm not gonna die here. And I'm not gonna let you die here either. BOOMER: Okay, let's go! TIGH: Don't worry, I'll get us home. ELLEN: Yeah, right. - Just like Bill's getting us to Earth. - Don't start on Bill. [Ellen sighs heavily.] He doesn't have the slightest idea where Earth is. You don't have to yell it through the halls. Bill Adama doesn't know where Earth is! - Colonel. - Doctor. BALTAR: Actually, I don't believe I've had the pleasure. - I'm Dr. Gaius - Baltar. I know exactly who you are. And the pleasure's all mine. Something here, isn't there? ELLEN: You're still holding my hand. BALTAR: That's funny. I thought you were still holding onto mine. I'm watching you. Both of you. NO. 6: And you should be watching her. Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor? I'd love to. GAETA: [Over PA system.] Dr. Baltar, report to the lab. The Commander is waiting. - But I can't. Another time, perhaps. - Count on it. Ta-ta! - Oh, Saulie, are you jealous? - You said we were starting over. We are, sweetheart, we are. That was just a little harmless flirting. ELLEN: You should know something. TIGH: What? In the middle of dinner - Bill put his hand on my leg. - Ellen, I'm not falling for this. Did you know he came to see me on the Rising Star? What? He'd come into my room. I'd pretend to be asleep. Then he'd sit by the side of my bed - and then he'd touch me. - Why are you doing this? You're lying. I am not. He was on that ship. I'll prove it. Come on! Look, it's not magic. It's science. If you want the right result, you have to wait awhile. I gave you her sample this morning. I have started and stopped the test twice already now so I'm running a little behind. - Twice? - My fault. Long story. Your fault? - I shouldn't have mentioned that. - You shouldn't have. - Did you tell him to stop Ellen's test? - Yes, I did. - Why? - I had some concerns. About what? In all honesty, I think it's fair to say that your behaviour recently has been odd. My behaviour? What do you think, I'm a Cylon? Me? You can't deny that you've been making these off-log calls, these mysterious trips off the ship. Where did you hear that? Have you been spying on me? On my own ship? Ladies and gentlemen, please. We're in a laboratory. There are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere. That's a thermo-nuclear bomb, for frak's sakes. What do you mean "un-logged"? "Mysterious trips"? What's going on? I had to go to the Rising Star and I didn't want Tigh to know. Why not? Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon, she's trouble and I wanted to keep her away as long as I could. Then why did you bring her aboard the ship? Because she's his wife. And I couldn't refuse her access to her own husband without causing suspicion. Besides, I wanted her close to me. I told you. I told you he wanted me. - Lovely. - What the hell's going on? You have been secretly visiting my wife? No. Yes. But it's complicated. - I told you. He's been after me for years. - What? Now boys, boys, don't fight over little old me. - Ellen, be quiet! - You don't tell me what to do. APOLLO: We should all take a deep breath. ROSLIN: I will! I was afraid that she might be a Cylon! I brought her blood here to test it. TIGH: That's why you cancelled your test. ADAMA: How'd you know that? TIGH: You didn't tell me he was testing my wife. - You met with the President? - Yes. She thought you might be a Cylon. I know. GAETA: Attention. Pass the word for the Commander, XO and the CAG. Commander Adama, Col. Tigh, and Captain Adama, please report to CIC. ADAMA: Mr. Gaeta. The Raider smoothed out its flight path about two minutes ago. It seems to be under control. - Yeah, but he's not jumping for home. - No, sir, he isn't. Has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications since he straightened out his flight pattern? Yes, sir, but it's likely it's just another distress signal. Launch the alert fighters. This is the CAG. Launch the alert fighters. Sir, I hate to tell you this, but I think it's been playing with us the entire time. It was waiting to see how we'd react. - Playing with us? - Yeah. - Order the flight leader to destroy the target! - Yes, sir. Galactica, Hot Dog. The Raider just took off! He doesn't look injured to me. He's heading back to the fleet! - They're not going to catch him. - Action Stations, set Condition One. - This is not a drill. - He doesn't have any weapons. He's on a suicide run. [Dramatic instrumental music.] - Did you launch the alert fighters? - It was the XO's call. - I had a hunch. - Good call. - One question. - Because I was worried. - That she might be a Cylon. - And if she wasn't. I know how you feel about her, Saul. She's been a negative force in your life. I'm sorry, but it's the truth. Maybe she was. Everything was different then. She was different. I was different. I've grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand. So I had a couple of drinks tonight. - I was celebrating. I think I deserved to - Yes, you did. Launching those fighters on a hunch. You saved our ship. TIGH: Just doing my job. ADAMA: You do your job good. That's why I need you, Saul. That, and that we're friends. I don't want anything to come between that, not even Ellen. It won't. [Solemn instrumental music.] DORAL: We've searched every street, every building. They slipped through. How's that possible? She thinks she loves him. Now that she can't live without him. Her passion is making her more resourceful. - Bothers you, doesn't it? - We'll get them in the end. No, it bothers you that you've never experienced it. [Chuckling.] You saw the way Helo was when we took her away? He was pathetic. I can't help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely. Even in his anguish, he seemed so alive. [lntense instrumental music.] Green. Green, everyone. Mrs. Tigh is definitely human. - No hard feelings, I hope, Ellen. - I completely understand. But let's be sure and test you next. - Doctor? - My pleasure. My job. You don't want to frak with me, Bill. Try to remember that. Don't frak with me either, Ellen. If only they knew that everyone passes these days. Why, it's so much simpler that way. No muss, no fuss. What did her test really say? I'll never tell. [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] Zak failed basic flight. And I should have flunked him, but I didn't. The bottom line is that I killed him. Walk out of this cabin while you still can. HELO: I don't get it. How does a military coded signal end up coming from in here? [Helo laughs.] HELO: Food. GAETA: It's the Cylons. Starbuck's wireless and transponder just cut out. TIGH: Starbuck's gonna take on all eight. And get herself killed. [Loud crashing.] BOOMER: Galactica. Hot Dog's aboard. HELO: Yeah, so is his lunch. Take it easy, Hot Dog. You're not the first to lose it in combat. HELO: You won't be the last. No sign of Starbuck. He says she was hit but still in the fight when he lost track of her. DUALLA: Roger that. Search and rescue ops are underway for Starbuck. Bring Hot Dog in. The old man wants to talk to him. ADAMA: This is where you found him? Yes, sir, he drifted quite a ways from the fight. ADAMA: Was she manoeuvring? HOT DOG: I think so. Yes. Yes, sir. So she survived the initial hits. She could still be alive. She is alive, Lieutenant. We're gonna find her. BOOMER: Yes, sir. ADAMA: Get this man to sick bay. APOLLO: Yes, sir. I think you earned those today. The auxiliary RT switch sticks a little, sir, but she'll fly. - Polish up the canopy. I want it crystal clear. - Yes, sir. - Find her. - I will. [Engine whirring.] [lntense instrumental music.] [Wind howling.] [Starbuck grunting in pain.] [Starbuck coughing.] [lntense instrumental music continues.] [Theme music.] GAETA: Still no joy from the search teams. In the last four hours we've combed everywhere in a 200 click sphere around Starbuck's last known position. No ship, no ejection seat, no debris. So we're extending the radius another 50. - We need more pilots. - Everybody who can fly is up, sir. What about Starbuck's course computations? The variables of combat manoeuvring make them almost meaningless. - It's time to start guessing. - Yes, sir. Since there's been no dradis contact in the area I would have to guess that her Viper was captured by the gravity of a planetary body. The only nearby gravity wells are the gas giant and this moon. If the gas giant pulled her in, its radiation would fry her like an egg. What about the moon? The spectroscope people call the atmosphere as CO2, methane, some argon. The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons. GAETA: Cold as hell down there, but she'd survive on the surface. - Until her oxygen runs out. - When? GAETA: Forty-six hours and change, sir. Hell of a long time to stay in one place. - What if the Cylons appear? - They won't, not for a while. What makes you say that? Sending a patrol instead of the base ship tells me they didn't even know we were here. So they're searching a lot of other places, places with potential supplies. Like staking out water holes in the desert. If we sent eight fighters to search an entire star system for 60-odd ships, it would take us weeks Assume they're better and faster. It'll take them days. - A lot of assumptions you're making. - Educated guess. - Talk to me about searching the moon. - That's going to be slow going. We can't see squat through those clouds. Send the ships below the cloud cover. Tell the pilots to take a hard look the old-fashioned way. Mark One Eyeball, sir? Mark One Eyeball. Commander, call from Colonial One. Adama. Commander Adama, I don't wanna take much of your time. I wanted to say how happy we all are you found one of your pilots. ADAMA: Thank you, Madam President. How is the search progressing for the other pilot? Nothing yet, but we've just begun. ROSLIN: I've spoken with the other captains in the fleet. They've agreed to give over their ships at your disposal if it'll increase the odds of finding her. ADAMA: Frack the odds. We're going to find her. Excuse me. Thank you. Tell them we could sure use the help. I'll coordinate their efforts with your CIC. Continued good luck. ADAMA: Thank you. Thank you. [Seductive instrumental music.] So it looks like we're going to be staying here for a while. [Baltar loudly clearing his throat.] - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, it's just a How long you think it will be before the Cylons wonder what happened to their missing patrol, and send another one here to look for it? You have attacked us hundreds of times. We're still here. I think you'll find that we are more than adequately protected. Might be a little tricky with the fleet scattered over half this system Iooking for the lost pilot. NO. 6: How many days till the Cylons return, Gaius? One? [Seductive instrumental music continues.] NO. 6: Two? Three at the most? ROSLIN: Doctor? [Seductive music stops.] Your requisitions. Thank you. BALTAR: Madam President, I don't mean to be impertinent, really, but do you honestly think this is wise? You are compromising the security of the entire fleet while we search for one solitary pilot. It is a risk, but those pilots put their lives on the line for us every day. Yes. I was just saying that, to BALTAR: I'm not insensitive, that is what I'm saying. BALTAR: I happen to know the missing pilot personally. Not as personally as you'd like. Guess you'll never find out if she's a real blonde. It's all the more difficult for me. On one hand I think of the pilot. And on the other hand I think of the thousands of defenceless women and children. I meant, throughout the fleet. I am sure Commander Adama has considered all of this. - Thank you, Doctor. - Yes, of course he has. Of course he has. Thank you. [Baltar sighs heavily.] [Wind howling.] [lntense instrumental music.] It's okay. Okay, get to higher ground. Then they see you. Then they rescue you. Apollo, Galactica, we are being bounced around like beach balls down here. APOLLO: Visibility about two, best spectrum. DUALLA: Copy, Apollo. Blue! Blue flight, go vertical now! [Engine whirring loudly.] [Radio tuning.] [Boomer groaning.] - Anything? - No. - I don't think anyone's left out there. - Must be someone. We can't be the only two people left in the world. Good news is my leg's much better and we've got anti-radiation meds to last three months. HELO: I say we load up as much food as we can and BOOMER: Move out. Try to find a Raptor or a transport or something we can fly off Caprica. Unless you can think of a reason to stay. Not really looking forward to going back out there. HELO: I've almost started to think of this place as HELO: home. BOOMER: Home. No, sleep a little longer. Who knows when we'll find clean sheets again. I'm going to go topside and make some breakfast. Breakfast. [Helo whistling a tune.] [Glass shattering.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Heavy footsteps approaching.] [Gun cocking.] [Suspenseful instrumental music continues.] Hey, is breakfast ready? HELO: Get out of here! Go! [Rapid gunshots firing.] Lords, it's Kara Thrace. I'm running a little low on O2 and I could use a lucky break. You know? Okay, just thought I'd mention it. [Tense instrumental music.] [Starbuck laughs dryly.] Not bad shooting, if I do say so myself. Lords, I owe you one. Looks like I found my ride out of here. If I can fix you up. [Alarm blaring.] Galactica, Apollo. Bingo fuel. DUALLA: Roger, Apollo. Return to base. APOLLO: Can't you tank me in orbit? DUALLA: Negative, Apollo. The tankers are refilling. You'll be dry before they can launch. ADAMA: Are these figures correct? GAETA: Yes, sir. GAETA: Atmospheric ops mean Viper and Raptor engines run continuously. Fuel's going to be a real problem if we keep it up. ADAMA: Any report from the civilian ships? TIGH: Nothing. They're spread pretty far out. We'll have a hell of a time trying to cover them if the Cylons pop in. We should consider pulling the civvies into a defensible formation. No. Keep all the ships on the search. We've left enough people behind. I don't wanna leave Starbuck behind. - Committing the entire fleet to this - I said no! We are going to find our missing pilot and we're going to bring her home. We leave no one behind. Resume your duties. [Tense instrumental music.] HELO: Sharon? HELO: Sharon, where are you? [Tense instrumental music continues.] Damn it, Sharon, where are you? Sharon! Frack me. Are you alive? [Gasping.] What the hell happened this time, Captain? I hit the roll thrusters to level off for set down but only the left one fired. It's that crap you're flying into down there. Gums everything up. Get me another Viper. TYROL: Love to, but this is 13 Vipers that are down, plus your Mark VII. I'm out. I've got a pilot down and I need another Viper now. I realise that, Captain. But you can push people a lot further than machines. I'm the CAG, you're the Chief. Just make it happen. Commander, the clock has passed five hours, sir, for Starbuck's O2 supply. Noted. GAETA: Here's the photo mosaic for the area we searched so far. We've got to do better than this. Can't see far when you're hugging the ground. You can't see anything from altitude. Not to mention the crap in the air that keeps screwing up our ships. APOLLO: Thirteen Vipers down for repairs. ADAMA: We need more eyes. TIGH: Where we going to get them? APOLLO: Pull the CAP. TIGH: What? Redeploy the Combat Air Patrol to the search. Bad idea. The CAP is the fleet's only defence. If all Vipers are fracking around on the moon when the Cylons come calling, we're maggot meat. Then bring the fleet closer to the moon. We can always scramble the Vipers from the search to meet any attack. Bottom line: we can double the area we can search in the time we have left. Starbuck would be the first one to tell you not to do this. Nothing would make you happier, would it? Leave her behind. Get rid of the foul-mouthed insubordinate pilot that keeps challenging your authority. You are way out of line. I'm not the one confusing personal feelings with duty. What the hell does that mean? You are way too close to this because she's your friend. Gentlemen! We have work to do. Captain. Get as many birds up in the air as you can and you find our girl. You got it. STARBUCK: Oh, my gods. You bite me, I'll bite you back. [Eerie instrumental music.] STARBUCK: So I guess the only thing flying you is you. This must be your brain. I don't think you'll need it. Good thing that I brought one of my own. Even cockroaches have to breathe. How the hell do you? SOCINUS: Captain. Call for you, sir. Can someone finish this up for me? APOLLO: Where is it? SOCINUS: That way. APOLLO: Yeah, Apollo. BILLY: Hold for President Roslin. ROSLIN: How're you holding up? Better than my Viper. We're slapping one together from pieces of the others. ROSLIN: I need your help. Did you know that your father just redeployed the Combat Air Patrol? - Yes, Madam President. It was my idea. - Your idea? We need every Viper we've got. ROSLIN: Maybe I'm missing something about the tactics involved. But isn't the fleet defenceless without the CAP? APOLLO: Only for a short time. Because after that, Kara's oxygen will be gone and she'll be dead. Are you very close with Lt. Thrace? I'm close with all my pilots. And I assume the same is true for your father? His pilots mean a lot to him. To all of us. We don't leave anyone behind. But we have left people behind. You know that. Not this time. Your FTL drive should be spun up and ready. Just make sure everyone is set to jump at the first sign of trouble. With all due respect, Captain there are times when it is necessary for the safety of the fleet to put Not this time. We just haven't exhausted all the options and the safety of the fleet has not been compromised. - I hope you find her. - Thank you. Blue flight reports bingo fuel, sir. Have them stay on the search. Send the tanker to them. Is there a problem, Mr. Gaeta? It's just that trying to tank in that turbulence, sir, will be extremely hairy. I suggest we wait until the clock has run down and then tank up on the way back to Galactica. Did someone call them back to Galactica? - I just assumed - The search was over? It was hopeless? That we should write Starbuck off as dead? - Is that what you're telling me, Mr. Gaeta? - No, sir. Then what are you trying to tell me, Mr. Gaeta? [Alarm blaring.] - You have your orders. - Yes, sir. Time is up. She's out of O2. The clock is a guess. ADAMA: We don't know for a fact that Starbuck is out of air. Her tank only holds so much oxygen. She could have a reserve supply in her survival gear. TIGH: A reserve? ADAMA: Yes. What, she just happened to pack an extra bottle today? It's possible. We are putting people at risk. - We have pilots out there - We are not quitting. pushing themselves, their ships too hard, all for the sake of We are not quitting and you are relieved, Colonel. [Military instrumental music.] I stand relieved, sir. [Tense instrumental music.] Come on, you're part biological, right? Which means you need oxygen, right? So it's got to be here, somewhere. [Gasping.] Commander, the President. Adama. Commander Adama, I just wanted to say how very sorry I am about Lt. Thrace. Please give my condolences to your son and to the rest of the crew. Excuse me, Madam, but I think you've been misinformed. - How? - We don't know if Starbuck's dead. ROSLIN: I was told that her oxygen had run out a half an hour ago. That's an estimate. She may have a reserve supply. We'll continue the search as long as there's a chance she may be alive. ROSLIN: And how long will that be? ADAMA: Until I say stop. This is a military decision, Madam President. Thank you for your concern. STARBUCK: First on the list, seal you up figure out what controls what. One of us needs a bath. Now you're going to teach me how to fly. Red Flight reports an area of highlands here. - Increased visibility out to 15 clicks maybe. - It's the wrong side of the moon. DUALLA: Commander ADAMA: Almost impossible to We have a signal from Colonial One's shuttle. They request permission to land. The President's on board. Why wasn't I notified the President was coming onboard? There was no advance notice, sir. GAETA: I didn't know she was coming. ADAMA: Let's go. ADAMA: Have Col. Tigh meet her at the airlock. ADAMA: Bring her to my quarters, please. DUALLA: Very well. Every flying machine has four basic controls: power, pitch, yaw, and roll. Where are yours? [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Safety tip number one: don't touch that. Are you going to order us to stop the search? I came here to talk, not to give orders. - It may take an order. - Why? Col. Tigh, do I need to know something? It's gone beyond military needs. It's personal for the Commander and Lee. Because of Lt. Thrace? Because of her, and because of Zak Adama. ROSLIN: The Commander's dead son. It's complicated. Take about three weeks to explain. We've got about three minutes. Talk fast. She's going to press. I'm with you. TIGH: President Roslin. ADAMA: Madam President. Skip the formalities. You both know why I'm here. Termination of a pilot's rescue mission is a military decision. That's a bunch of crap. This isn't military, it's personal. Neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace because she's your last link to Zak. - You don't know anything about my brother. - Don't even begin, Captain. You've lost perspective. As have you. Under normal circumstances it would just be sad that you two can't come to terms with Zak's death. In this situation you're putting your pilots at risk. You're exposing the fleet to possible attack every moment we stay here. We've been at risk of an attack since day one. ADAMA: The Cylons won't be missing their patrol for at least one more day. Col. Tigh, how much aviation fuel has been expended in this operation? Forty-three percent of reserves. Almost half. That's unacceptable. Operations in the moon's atmosphere have put one third of your fighters out of action. That is also completely unacceptable. Crap. Unacceptable. Whatever it is you feel about this the recovery of one pilot is a military matter. All right. It's military. Fine. And you're both officers. And you're both honourable men. You're both perfectly aware that you are putting the lives of over 45,000 people and the future of this civilisation at risk for your personal feelings. Now if the two of you, of all people, can live with that then the human race doesn't stand a chance. Clear your heads. [Sober instrumental music.] Combat. Stand-by. This is the Commander. Terminate search operations. Bring everyone home. Prepare the fleet to make a jump to the next system. We're leaving. Okay, so it either works or it doesn't. [Engine starting.] [Laughing happily.] Okay, it's power, roll, pitch, and yaw. We have control. Take me home. [Dramatic instrumental music.] You stink, but you're one hell of a flying machine. I want you to know, I think she's wrong. I think we have come to terms with what happened to Zak. I haven't. I need to know something. Why did you do this? Why did we do this? Is it for Kara? For Zak? For what? Kara was family. You do whatever you have to do. Sometimes you break the rules. - And if it was me down there instead? - You don't have to ask that. Are you sure? If it were you we'd never leave. ADAMA: Colonel. TIGH: Commander. - Resume your duties. - Sir, fighters are aboard, sir. Civilian ships have begun their jumps to the next star system. TIGH: Give the word, we'll start our clock. ADAMA: Start the clock. TIGH: Mr. Gaeta, start the clock. GAETA: Starting clock. Madam President, would you like to return to your ship? Thank you, I'll stay here. I'd like to see how the professionals do it. As you wish. - Execute jump, Lt. Gaeta. - Aye, sir. Jump clock is running. GAETA: Navigation? CREWMAN 1: Go. GAETA: FTL? CREWMAN 2: Go. GAETA: Tactical? CREWMAN 3: Go. GAETA: Flight Ops? Contact. Dradis contact. Incoming, bearing 060, carom 308. - Hold count. - Count held. DUALLA: Contact is CREWMAN 1: Hold the count. Well? [lntense instrumental music.] - Cylon Raider, sir. - You're right. It's just a matter of time. He's on an intercept course. He'll be on us before we complete the jump. Action stations, launch Vipers. TIGH: [Over PA.] Action stations. Launch alert, Vipers. Cylon Raider approaching. [Alarm blaring.] STARBUCK: Now look before you shoot, please. GAETA: Gun captains report weapons manned and ready. TIGH: Where the hell are the Vipers? DUALLA: Most are being fuelled. DUALLA: Hot Dog and Apollo are in the tubes. LAUNCH OFFICER: Viper I, clear forward. Navcon Green, interval failure. Abort launch. Frack! I guess I'm going solo. Why only one Cylon this time? It could be a lone recon mission or the vanguard for a Cylon base ship about to jump on top of us. Either way, we're going to have to take it out before we can jump. Galactica, Apollo. Target in sight. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] You idiot. Didn't anybody teach you intercept protocol? STARBUCK: Okay, we're going to have to do this the hard way then. This bastard's good. They're closing fast. Port guns have a firing solution. Very well. - Hold still, you little - No cigar for you. Just come a little bit closer. Not that close! What the I've lost him. Galactica, I repeat, he is nowhere to be seen. - Dradis. - No help. Their reports have merged. TIGH: Launch tube status? DUALLA: Still fouled. - We'll have a Viper away in 45 seconds. - This will be over in 45 seconds. Holy Galactica, the Cylon is now flying in formation with me right above my head. APOLLO: This thing is acting weird. ADAMA: Put me through. [Laughing happily.] APOLLO: It's Starbuck! ADAMA: What? Come again, Apollo. Galactica, the Cylon Raider is marked "Starbuck." It's written under the fracking wing. [All cheering.] Bring it into the bay. If it does anything, take it out. APOLLO: Wilco, Galactica, but I tell you what, it's got to be her. This thing is flying with some serious attitude. [Apollo laughing.] Now your ass belongs to me. Like my new toy? Boy, when you take a souvenir, you don't screw around. - Oh, my God, you smell like a latrine. - You want to give me a bath? - How're you feeling? - Been a hell of a lot worse. Don't have any ambrosia, but the Doc can fix you up with some really nice stuff. It's not bad, is it? The knee? Doc says it's too early to tell, but knowing you, you'll be fine. - Kara. - Yeah? You did good. [Soft instrumental music.] ADAMA: [Whispering.] Get better, okay? - Need anything? - A stogie would be nice. I had a feeling. - It's my last one, so enjoy it. - Thank you. Get some rest. [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica: [Dramatic instrumental music.] ADAMA: Doral! When this body dies, my consciousness will be transferred to another one. The Cylons have the ability to mimic human form. They look like us now. This man has been identified as a Cylon agent. - You sleep, I watch. - No. You're the one who needs sleep. You were lucky that you didn't lapse into a coma. The time is going to come when you won't be able to hide what you're going through. [Ominous instrumental music.] [Rumbling.] [Whispering.] [Whispering continues.] [Roslin panting.] [Ominous instrumental music intensifies.] Laura. [Gasping.] [Sombre instrumental music.] [Knocking on door.] ROSLIN: Yes? Madam President, are you okay in there? I'm fine, it's just the side effects from the Chamalla. ROSLIN: You know that thing they say, "What's worse? The cancer or the cure?" What do you need? You have an urgent call from the Captain of the Gemenon Traveller. ROSLIN: Can I call him back? BILLY: He says he found a Cylon on board. [Tense instrumental music.] ROSLIN: They found him in the starboard storage compartment. ROSLIN: Looked like he'd been camped here for days. ADAMA: Are they sure it's a Cylon? ROSLIN: The captain identified him by one of the photos we sent out. He's another copy of the man you knew as Leoben Conroy. Where is it now? Aboard the Gemenon Traveller, locked in a storeroom, under guard. Isolate that ship. Order the CAP to fly escort around the Gemenon Traveller. And not to approach any other ship in the fleet. Aye, sir. Kat, Galactica, fly close I'll send a team over to destroy it immediately. ROSLIN: I want this man interrogated first. ADAMA: First of all it's not a him, it's an it second, anything it says cannot be trusted. Best thing to do is destroy it immediately. I'd like to hear what this thing has to say. It might be important. Madam President, I've dealt with this model before. ADAMA: lt'll fill your head with doubletalk, half-baked philosophy and confuse you. Then send someone who won't be easily confused. That's an order, Commander. ROSLIN: I want him interrogated. Order understood. STARBUCK: Think it'll give me something? ADAMA: No. ADAMA: President disagrees. You need me to go, I'll shower up and go. How's this coming? We got the entire avionics package figured out. Fire control, navigation and I think that I am zeroing in on her FTL drive. I did this in a hurry about three weeks ago. It's my after-action report on Leoben. It's a very clever machine. Manipulative, cunning. The only problem with Leoben isn't that he lies. That would be too easy. It's that he mixes lies with truth. Just remember, he's gonna try to get into your head. My mum always said there was nothing in there anyway. [Starbuck laughs.] [Whispering.] Just be careful. He has an agenda. It's a goal you won't understand until later. Your job is to make sure he doesn't achieve the goal. Yes, sir. [Solemn instrumental music.] [Theme music.] [Boomer humming.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] TYROL: Lieutenant. - What's up? - Nothing. Just wanted to see if what I told you the other day helped at all? Yeah. Actually it did. You do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine and it actually works. TYROL: Where did you come up with that anyway? Just pop into your head? - I'm a Cylon. - You know, that's not even funny. If I could prove that I wasn't would that make a difference? You know, between us? [Sombre instrumental music.] PILOT: Gemenon Traveller, Raptor seven-one-niner inbound with Lt. Thrace aboard. Permission to dock. MAN: Roger, seven-one-niner. Permission granted. CAPTAIN: Really does look like a person. STARBUCK: Yeah. CAPTAIN: Must be all full of wires inside. STARBUCK: No, you cut him open, there's blood, guts the whole thing. It's sweating. Well, I'll be. Look at that. God, they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people. CAPTAIN: Why do you think they do that? STARBUCK: I don't care why. STARBUCK: But the fact that these things sweat now that's interesting. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Door bangs shut.] STARBUCK: Sleeping? Praying. I don't think the Gods answer the prayers of toasters. God answers everyone's prayers. - How many Cylons are there in the fleet? - We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Leoben. STARBUCK: How many Cylons in the fleet? LEOBEN: I have no idea. [Chains rattling.] What's your name? How long have you been hiding aboard this ship? Am I not allowed to know your name? STARBUCK: Why were you hiding here? LEOBEN: I had a mission to perform. Listen, it's a small thing. Can you just tell me who you are? Tell me about your mission and I'll think about it. - My mission was to conduct sabotage. - What kind of sabotage? God, you stink. Can I get some air in here? Between you and the humidity. STARBUCK: I am not here to play games with you. You said you wanted to cooperate. Either start talking or we are done. Okay. But I really wanna know your name. STARBUCK: Open. Are you Lt. Starbuck? [Tense instrumental music.] [Leoben laughs.] Yes, you are. I knew [Laughing continues.] LEOBEN: I was right. I was right. I saw it. I've seen it. - Happy now? - It all makes sense now. Doesn't it? LEOBEN: Now we can talk. Now we can talk about a lot of things. Like what? I planted a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ships. It's set to go off at 1830 hours. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] Where? I'm not ready to give that up yet. You're lying. There's no warhead. You can't take the chance, Starbuck. Your military training dictates you take it to your masters and let them decide. Maybe my training wasn't so good. Maybe I push you out the air lock, and tell them you never said a word. Now, who's lying. These things happen for a reason, don't they? I'm looking forward to spending more time with you. We have a lot to talk about. It's gonna be fun. Put the Red Team on alert immediately. Dee? And sweep Galactica for any kind of radiological devices. Right. Contact all the captains in the fleet. ADAMA: Have them do radiological sweeps of their ships. ADAMA: But emphasize that this is just a precaution. ADAMA: I don't wanna alarm anyone until we're sure. Yes, sir. Well, we'll know for sure in 8 hours and 40 minutes. Lt. Thrace, did he say anything else? No. He guessed my call sign. Seemed really happy when he found out who I was. ADAMA: He's playing with your mind. He's been stowed away for weeks aboard the fleet. Fifty ways he could've heard the word "Starbuck" on a wireless set. That's what I figured, sir. ROSLIN: Any idea what he wants? Not yet. Says he's looking forward to spending some time with me, though. Don't take any chances, Starbuck. Yes, sir. You believe in the Gods, don't you? Lords of Kobol, and all that? STARBUCK: Why should I tell you? It's not a trick question. I wanted to see how much I got right. So you pray to Artemis, Aphrodite? STARBUCK: Where's the warhead? I was right. See, our faiths are similar, but I look to one God, not to many. I don't give a damn about what you believe. To know the face of God, is to know madness. [lntense instrumental music.] I see the universe. I see the patterns. LEOBEN: I see the foreshadowing that precedes every moment of every day. It's all there. I see it. And you don't. And I have a surprise for you. I have something to tell you about the future. STARBUCK: Is that so? LEOBEN: It is. But we have to see this thing through till the end. [Door opens.] [Starbuck clears throat.] What is the most basic article of faith? LEOBEN: This is not all that we are. [Starbuck exhales.] The difference between you and me is, I know what that means and you don't. I know that I'm more than this body, this consciousness. A part of me swims in the stream. But in truth, I'm standing on the shore. The current never takes me downstream. This is worse than Galactica. And I didn't think that was possible. And what was that? Swimming in streams or something? Do you mind? LEOBEN: Thank you. [Sighing.] Starving. Haven't eaten in days. Kind of bad programming, isn't it? I mean, why bother with hunger? - Part of being human. - You're not human. How's your lunch? You know how it is. When you're starving, anything tastes good. [Leoben exclaims.] [Tense instrumental music.] [Grunting.] Did that hurt? Yeah, that hurt. STARBUCK: Machines shouldn't feel pain shouldn't bleed shouldn't sweat. Sweat. That's funny. That's good. See, a smart Cylon would turn off the old pain software about now. But I don't think you're so smart. Maybe I'll turn it off and you won't even know. STARBUCK: Here's your dilemma. Turn off the pain, you feel better, but that makes you a machine, not a person. You see, human beings can't turn off their pain. Human beings have to suffer and cry, and scream, and endure because they have no choice. So the only way you can avoid the pain you're about to receive is by telling me exactly what I wanna know. Just like a human would. I knew this about you. You're everything I thought you would be. But it won't work. I won't tell you anything. Maybe not. But then, you'll know deep down that I beat you that a human being beat you and that you are truly no greater than we are. You're just a bunch of machines after all. Let the games begin. Hi. [Soft instrumental music.] [Door opening.] Well, look what the cat dragged in. BALTAR: Lt. Valerii. It's an unexpected visit. BALTAR: You look wonderful. [Door bangs shut.] BOOMER: I need your help. BALTAR: Anything I can do. Anything at all. Wonder why they call her "Boomer"? I heard you were working on a test to tell the difference between Cylons and humans. Bingo. I can't really talk about that at the moment. You wouldn't help settle a bet for me, would you? BALTAR: Why do they call you "Boomer"? If you're working on a Cylon detector, do you think I could be in the first batch? You know, to be tested? - What's her rush? - What's your rush? BALTAR: I'm not sure it would be appropriate to show favouritism if indeed I am working on anything at all. I saved your life back on Caprica. My co-pilot gave up his seat for you. I brought you back to Galactica, to safety. You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me. You owe me. She shoots. She scores. BALTAR: I suppose there's some small truth to that. So can you test me or not? I think you should do it. Results will be quite intriguing. BALTAR: The technology for Cylon detection is not quite ready for full-scale implementation. But I could use a beta test subject. Sharon's late. Half an hour. I notice you're calling her Sharon now. Yeah, I choose to think of her as one of them. Because you dislike her? Because in the scheme of things, we are as we do. She acts like one of them, thinks like them. She is one of them. But she's one of us. It would be best to remember that. - We had sex. - Congratulations. NO. 6: Does he love you? BOOMER: I think so. No. 6: Has he said it? BOOMER: Not directly. Then you're just guessing. Stay in your current location. We're setting up a cabin for you nearby. Food, water, electricity. All the comforts. Shouldn't be too hard to convince him to stay and start a life together. NO. 6: If not, kill him. Can you handle that? [Tense instrumental music.] We made it this far, we'll make it all the way. Something happened to you, I wouldn't know how to deal with it. Caprica. [Thunder clapping.] DORAL: If he flees, he dies. NO. 6: Does he love you? Helo. HELO: Hey, what's going on? BOOMER: Come on. We gotta go. Now. I saw Cylons. They're heading this way. We got to travel fast, even faster than before. - Why? What's different? - Everything. Just trust me. I do. [Panting.] [Leoben groaning.] Now, if you were human you'd be just about ready to start offering up some false information about the location of the nuke. STARBUCK: Some tiny thing that may get you a reward and spare you some of this. But then I keep forgetting you're not human. STARBUCK: You're a machine. I am more than you could ever imagine. [Panting.] I am God. I'm sorry. You're God? [Laughing mockingly.] Wow. Nice to meet you. That's good. We'll give you a couple of minutes with that. It's funny, isn't it? We're all God, Starbuck. All of us. I see the love that binds all living things together. Love? You don't even know what the word means. I know that God loved you more than all other living creatures and you repaid his divine love with sin with hate, corruption, evil. So then he decided to create the Cylons. The Gods had nothing to do with it. We created you. Us. It was a stupid, fracked up decision, and we have paid for it. You slaughtered my entire civilisation. That is sin. That is evil. And you are evil. [Sombre instrumental music.] Am I? LEOBEN: I see the truths that float past you in the stream. STARBUCK: You have a real thing about rivers and streams, don't you? I think we should indulge you in your obsession. Do you realise I could kill you before they came back in the room? I could get to my feet rip your skull from your spinal column crash through that door kill the guard in less time than it has taken me to describe it to you. Then why don't you? It's not the time. [Dramatic instrumental music.] GUARD: He's loose! [Starbuck gasping.] I have a surprise for you. You fracked up, pal. Now the gloves come off. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Combat, Col. Tigh. ADAMA: How's the search going for the nuke? Nothing so far. ADAMA: How much time remaining? TIGH: 2 hours, 9 minutes. Spread out the fleet. No ship more than 500 clicks from any other ship. - lf there's a nuke, let's limit the damage. - Aye, sir. No. Do it. [Leoben gurgling.] [Solemn instrumental music.] STARBUCK: Leave him. GUARD: Sir? [Leoben gasping and choking.] Tell me where the warhead is otherwise you're gonna drown in that bucket. I can't drown. I can't die. STARBUCK: Right. Commander Adama mentioned that how if your body dies your consciousness is downloaded or transferred into another body. Something like that. No, exactly like that. See, I've been thinking. Why is a Cylon willing to talk at all? Why does he care if we destroy his body? Won't he just transfer away and laugh at all of us and our stupid human ideas? [Leoben coughing.] STARBUCK: Tell me where the warhead is. This is not your path, Starbuck. You have a different destiny. Don't interrupt me. You see, I'm gonna dazzle you with my poor human brain. You see, I think that you're afraid. You're afraid that we're a long way from home. What if you don't transfer all the way back? What if when you die here, you really die? STARBUCK: It's your chance to find out if you're really God or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut. I'm not afraid of dying. Someone's programmed you with a fairytale of God, and streams, and life ever after. But somewhere in that hard drive you call a brain is a beeping message: "Error, error. Does not compute. "I don't have a soul. I have software. "If I die, I'm gone." [Climactic instrumental music.] [Gasping and choking.] [Panting.] I have a soul. I see patterns. I know you. You're damaged. You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered. [Panting.] Your life is a testament to pain. Injuries. Accidents. Some inflicted upon others, others inflicted upon yourself. It surrounds you like a bubble. But it's not real, it's just It's just something she put in your head. It's something that you wanna believe because it means you're the problem, not the world that you live in. You wanna believe it because it means that you're bad luck. You're like a cancer that needs to be removed. Because you hear her voice every day. And you want her to be right. Start again. [Tense instrumental music.] BALTAR: Now, we just pop this in the slot and wait for the results. Green, you're a normal human being. Red, you're an evil Cylon. [Chuckling.] Should take a couple of minutes. So tell me, are you from Aerilon? There's a slight trace of an accent there. BOOMER: What? No. Troy. BALTAR: Troy. Tell me, why is that familiar? Mining settlement. The accident. BALTAR: The explosion. Right. That was tragic. BALTAR: Your family? BOOMER: They died with the rest. I'm very sorry. [Beeping.] It's a lie. [Tense instrumental music.] Congratulations, Doctor. You've just uncovered your very first Cylon. Now, here's an interesting moment in the life of Gaius Baltar. What will he do? - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm just interpolating the results. The question is, what will she do if you expose her? Thank you or kill you? I thought it was just green or red. Well, it's a little more complicated than that. She probably doesn't know. She probably thinks she's just another girl from Troy whose entire background vanished in a mysterious accident. Should be interesting to see how she responds when you tell her the truth. I'm guessing her Cylon side will take over and break your neck before you can give away her secret. Let's find out. Congratulations, it's green. It's very bright green. - You're not a Cylon. - Really? For a second, I was worried what you were gonna say. BALTAR: Were you? BOOMER: Yeah. Well, there's nothing to be worried about anymore. [Stammering.] You couldn't be more human if you tried. - Well, thanks. - Anytime. I have something to tell you. How long before this supposed bomb goes off? Less than an hour. Get me a shuttle. I'm going to the Gemenon Traveller. I want to see the Cylon myself. BILLY: Madam President, you need to ROSLIN: Don't even start. I don't wanna discuss this. I've made my decision. Not until I get you a security detail. Enough. For frack's sake, let him breathe. [Leoben coughing.] You're really sick. You're not a person. You're a machine that's enjoying its own pain. All this has happened before. And all of it will happen again. Don't quote scripture. You don't have the right to use those words. You kneel before idols and ask for guidance. But you can't see that your destiny's already been written. LEOBEN: Each of us plays a role. Each time, a different role. Maybe the last time, I was the interrogator and you were the prisoner. The players change, the story remains the same. And this time this time your role is to deliver my soul to God. Do it for me. LEOBEN: It's your destiny and mine. [Sombre instrumental music.] And I told you I had a surprise for you. Are you ready? You're gonna find Kobol. Birthplace of us all. Kobol will lead you to Earth. This is my gift to you, Kara. [Climactic instrumental music.] ROSLIN: What the hell is going on here? What exactly is it that you are doing here? It's a machine, sir. - There's no limit to the tactics I can use. - And where's the warhead? STARBUCK: I don't know. ROSLIN: You don't know? ROSLIN: You spent the last eight hours torturing this man. This machine. ROSLIN: Whatever it is. And you don't have a single piece of information to show for it. He thinks he can see the future. Says he knows our destiny, our fate. He says we're gonna find Kobol, and that it's gonna lead us to Earth. Clean him up. There's not much time. Yes, sir. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] ROSLIN: Do you know who I am? LEOBEN: Yes. I apologise for what you've been through. ROSLIN: Take his restraints off. Do it. Thank you. I can do more. I can guarantee your safety. I can order your release. We are running out of time. We have only four minutes left until your bomb goes off. ROSLIN: I've come here to tell you that this conflict between our peoples does not have to continue. It can stop right here with us. We have to trust each other. Trust me. ROSLIN: I think you know you can. Tell me what I need to know, and you will live. The warhead doesn't exist. I made it up. Lieutenant was right. I was too far out. I didn't wanna die, so when I got caught, I made up a story to buy some time. I see. Thank you for the truth. LEOBEN: Thank you, Madam President. Don't be too hard on Kara. She was just doing her job. The military they teach you to dehumanise people. I'll take that into consideration. No, stand down. [Tense instrumental music.] Laura, I have something to tell you. [Whispering.] Adama is a Cylon. Yeah. [Sinister instrumental music.] - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - The bomb? - Nothing. - Put him out the airlock. - What? - You can't do that. Not after he told you - Yes, I can. And I will. Lieutenant, look at me. You've lost perspective. During the time I have allowed him to remain alive and captive on this ship he has caused our entire fleet to spread out defenceless. He puts insidious ideas in our minds. More lethal than any warhead. He creates fear. But you're right. He's a machine and you don't keep a deadly machine around. When it kills your people and threatens your future you get rid of it. [lntense instrumental music.] He's not afraid to die. He's just afraid that his soul won't make it to God. [Sympathetic instrumental music.] [Alarm sounding.] [Solemn instrumental music.] Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer. I don't know if he had a soul or not. But if he did, take care of it. Hell of a risk you took today. Something I had to do. Care to tell me why? President Adar once said that the interesting thing about being a President is that you don't have to explain yourself to anyone. [Tense instrumental music.] Something wrong? No. Nothing at all. [lntense instrumental music.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] Just do it. CRASHDOWN: Boomer, this could be it. This is the little planet that solves all of our problems. ELOSHA: What did you see? ROSLIN: A dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it. This planet is Kobol. Organise a ground survey team. Three Raptors. - They're everywhere! - We're not getting out of here! We need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue. If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow I will show us the way. What are you doing, Starbuck? Galactica. Apollo. She just jumped away. - Where the hell did she go? - Home. [All coughing.] CRASHDOWN: This is it! Now, come on! Now come on! Everybody up! CRASHDOWN: Come on! Go! CRASHDOWN: Come on, move! Out! TYROL: Come on, get him out of the chair. CRASHDOWN: Look at me. TYROL: I got him! CRASHDOWN: For gods' sakes, hurry! TYROL: Come on! TYROL: I got his legs. CRASHDOWN: I got him! TYROL: Put him on your shoulder. [Screaming.] CRASHDOWN: Doc! Come on, Doc! Crash! Doc! [Ethereal music.] NO. 6: Take my hand. Gaius, take my hand. Hey, come on! Wake up! Stay with me! We gotta go! Stay with me, Doc! Come on! CALLY: Come on! Bring him outside! It's gonna blow! [All screaming.] CRASHDOWN: Get down! Stay down. TYROL: How's he? You okay? We got full tanks. Let's see what we get. Getting them down. [Solemn instrumental music.] [Baltar exclaims in pain.] CALLY: You all right? You okay? CRASHDOWN: Get the supplies before they burn. Go. CALLY: Right away. TYROL: We crashed both tanks. The gas is gone. It's all gone. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] [Theme music.] It's a museum. So what? It's more than that. It's the home of the arrow of Apollo. HELO: What the hell is that? BOOMER 1: You never liked history. Come on, Helo. It's supposed to be the only clue as to the location of Earth. Earth? What are you talking about? Who's going to Earth? It doesn't even exist. I'm trying to get back to Galactica. What I need from you is a way off this planet, and a way back to my ship. If you don't do that, I'll blow your head off. Why don't you just shut up for a change? You're only alive because I've kept you alive. If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now. So whether you like it or not, I'm your only hope of getting off this planet. So if I were you, I'd take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up your ass. We can't move around the city during daylight. So we hole up and we wait till dark. [Wind whistling.] Unbelievable. She's crossed the line before, but this is so far beyond the pale She wouldn't have done this on her own. She was coerced. No one coerces Starbuck. Believe me, I've tried. Commander, I have the President on the line. ADAMA: Bear witness. Put on your headset. ADAMA: Madam President, moments ago, Lt. Thrace took the Cylon Raider - on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump. - Yes. Do you have any knowledge of this incident? Let's save some time here, Commander. The question you really want to ask me is whether or not I asked Lt. Thrace to take the Raider to Caprica. ROSLIN: The answer to your question is yes. [Ominous instrumental music.] - You and I had talked about this. - Yes, we had. ADAMA: We both decided it was a military decision. My responsibility as President is first and foremost to protect and preserve this fleet and its future. In the end, that outweighs any other consideration. It has to. By taking the Raider you've placed our people on the surface of Kobol in direct danger. ROSLIN: I'm very aware of the danger our men and women are in on Kobol. I am also deeply aware of the danger this civilisation will be in if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow. I'm going to have to ask you for your resignation, Madam President. ROSLIN: No. Then I'm terminating your presidency as of this moment. Commander Adama, I will exercise the authority of this office until I am unable to do so. So if you want to stage a coup you're gonna have to come over here and arrest me. - I don't want any bloodshed. - Of course you don't. Neither do I. Neither does the press. They're here, by the way. [Whispering.] The press. They're recording every minute. [Ominous instrumental music intensifies.] - What is it, Captain? - Isolate Colonial One. Mr. Gaeta. Jam any transmissions in or out of Colonial One immediately. - Yes, sir. - Prepare a strike team. As long as she's President, she's dangerous. If she can turn Starbuck against us, she's capable of anything. Yes, sir. - She's bluffing. - Well, let's hope so. There's also a Cylon base ship out there to deal with. Leave that to me. This government survived a Cylon attack. It will survive William Adama. ROSLIN: I think he's bluffing. But just in case, we need to be prepared. I know their security detail. They will defend that ship. We'll have to take her down compartment by compartment. ADAMA: Mr. Gaeta? GAETA: Sir. Am I correct in assuming that I have two Cylon transponders left? Yes, sir. But only one of them is fully functional. One will do. Now I need a pilot. BOOMER: Sir. ADAMA: As you were. - How are you feeling? - It looks worse than it is, sir. Things are moving very quickly and I need every pilot. I'm ready, sir. I have a very special mission for you and I won't kid around. - It's high risk, extremely high risk. - I understand. ADAMA: I need you to light-jump to Kobol and take care of this base star. We're placing a Cylon transponder aboard your Raptor. In theory, it should allow you to approach the base star without getting fired upon. But we'll still be ID'd as Colonial Raptors once we're in visual range. For all they know, you could be two Cylon agents returning with a captured Raptor. ADAMA: Once you're inside the defence perimeter I need you to make them think you want to dock. You have to fire your nuke into the loading bay and then jump back home immediately. Do you understand? I understand. I can do it, sir. I know I can. You have to. Yes, sir. [Fast-paced instrumental music.] [Starbuck panting.] [Groaning.] STARBUCK: This doesn't look good. Please tell me this was not all for nothing. [Exclaiming in exasperation.] I'm good. I am really good. I'm home. Wow, I'm home. [Monitor beeping.] [Ominous instrumental music.] Gaeta, please tell me that you're right about this transponder thing. [Ominous instrumental music intensifies.] [Boomer 1 tapping foot.] Stop. Stop that. I'm nervous. Like anything scares you. Things scare me, Helo. I have feelings. You have software. I don't know if you can hear this or not, Helo but what we had between us was important. It was very important. - Why? - Because it was the next step. Because it brings us closer to God. Don't mock the gods. It's a human belief. I'm human. They're our gods. But beyond that, I just want you to know that I genuinely feel something for you. I don't care. I don't love you. I loved what I thought was you. Helo, I think there's something else that you should know. [Climactic instrumental music.] I'm pregnant. APOLLO: [On radio.] Galactica, Apollo. We have visual on Colonial One. Tell Apollo he's cleared to begin the assault to contact us when he has soft-seal on the hull. Aye, sir. Commander, Boomer and Racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol. Put them through down here. ADAMA: Boomer, Galactica Actual. I just wanted to say good luck, good hunting and I have complete faith in the both of you. Thank you, Actual. We won't let you down. Racetrack, start the jump clock. [Beeping.] Clock is running. APOLLO: Galactica. Apollo. We have soft-seal. I know Commander Adama and I'm counting on the fact that when push comes to shove, he is the kind of man who will not want bloodshed. Nevertheless, this may not be the safest place. Billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold? There is room in the cargo hold and I implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians. This is my choice. ROSLIN: This is my choice. - You do not have to come with me. - We stand with our president. [Phone buzzing.] BILLY: Yes? Right. Security commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull. The Raptors are cutting through the hull, sir. Get the President on the line. [Solemn instrumental music.] You think this thing is working? [Electronic beeping.] We're about to find out. [Exclaiming in relie.] - I guess so. - Yeah. [Clearing throat.] - How are we doing on that? - It's not responding, sir. Are you even trained to use this thing? CRASHDOWN: How's he doing, Chief? [Tyrol sighs heavily.] Not doing so good. I don't now if his lungs are burned or what. Well, he's a tough kid. He's gonna pull through. Get those wounds looked at, Chief. TYROL: Yeah. Lieutenant? TYROL: Shouldn't we be moving out? - Do you have a plan for tactical deployment? - Plan for tactical deployment, Chief? Get to the high ground. It'll be our best chance of being seen by a search party. High ground is also our best chance of being seen by the Cylons. TYROL: They're flying around, sir. They might land the troops before we get rescued. CRASHDOWN: That's true. TYROL: Yeah. Sir, if I may suggest that we take cover on the ground maybe somewhere we won't be seen from the air? Okay, yeah. Chief, that's Carry on, Chief. Launch the nuke and prepare to jump. [Tense instrumental music.] Frack. What? The bomb release is jammed. I can't free it. [Alarm beeping.] We can dock inside the ship. - Excuse me? - They think we're Cylons. They'll let us dock. We can release the bomb manually and drop the nuke inside the ship itself. - It'll work. I know it. - Oh, my gods. [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Racetrack sighing in fear.] TYROL: Petard, Felix? TYROL: Wanna give me a hand here, please? FELIX: Yes, sir. TYROL: Cally, how's he doing? CALLY: Not good, sir. TYROL: Get a blanket on him. Keep him warm. NO. 6: How are you? [Solemn instrumental music.] BALTAR: Alive. You saved me. You saved my life. - Care to return the favour? - Are you in need of saving? You wondered why you were chosen? Why God chose you above all other humans to survive and serve His purpose? Now is the time to find out why. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] [Guns cocking.] [Tense instrumental music.] Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer. Bring us out of the darkness and into the light. Give us the strength to show mercy to those who are merciless The President says she will not yield. hearts that they may find peace The President says she will not yield. So be it. [Whispering.] Come on, D, tell me he's not actually gonna do this. [Whispering.] Tell me she's not gonna make him do it. Redeem our hearts that they may find peace in the midst of war. [Loud banging.] [Whispering.] What's going on? They're in. ROSLIN: Quickly. [Tense instrumental music continues.] Billy? Billy? Sir, they're in. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Solemn instrumental music.] Pretty, isn't it? [Starbuck groans.] Hello, Lieutenant. Something I can help you with? [lntense instrumental music.] [Eerie instrumental music.] I'm setting her down. [Rumbling.] Open the hatch. BOOMER: I'll release the bomb. BOOMER: Keep the engines ready for takeoff the second I get back. - Yes, sir. - Close the hatch after me. - lf I'm not back in five minutes, just go. - You got it. [Hatch door opening.] [Hatch door closing.] [Ominous instrumental music.] [Breathing heavily.] BOOMER: Oh, my God. [Tense instrumental music.] NO. 6: Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant. Like what we've done with the place? [lntense instrumental music.] [Starbuck grunting.] [Starbuck exclaiming in pain.] [lntense instrumental music continues.] [Beeping.] BOOMER 2: Sharon. [Chilling instrumental music.] RACETRACK: What the frack are you doing? Where are you going? Son of a bitch. [Panting.] Okay, okay. ALL: Sharon. [Climactic instrumental music.] This isn't happening. Come on, Starbuck. [Starbuck grunting.] [Gripping instrumental music.] Got anything left? [Starbuck exclaiming in pain.] [Starbuck screams maniacally.] Starbuck? Madam President, no one needs to get hurt here. Then why don't you get off my ship, Colonel? I'm placing you under arrest. - No. We're not doing this. - I'm in command here, Captain. - Colonel, this is wrong. - You're relieved. Fall back. Madam President, I wish to APOLLO: Men, lay down your weapons. TIGH: Have you lost your fracking mind? Colonel, tell these Marines to fall back. [Tense instrumental music.] TIGH: This is mutiny. You know that. APOLLO: Yes, I do. APOLLO: But you can tell my father I'm listening to my instincts. And my instincts tell me we cannot sacrifice our democracy just because the President makes a bad decision. Put your guns down. - Madam President, stand back. - Put your gun down, Captain. I will not have bloodshed, neither your men nor my people on the Colonial One. Put your gun down. All of you. Please, put your gun down. TIGH: Let's go. MARINE: Let's go, Captain. Let's go. [Chilling instrumental music.] BOOMER 2: You're confused. And scared. But it's okay. I'm not a Cylon. I'm Sharon Valerii. I was born on Troy. My parents were Katherine and Abraham Valerii. You can't fight destiny, Sharon. It catches up with you. No matter what you do. BOOMER 3: Don't worry about us. BOOMER 4: We'll see you again. - We love you, Sharon. - And we always will. [Tense instrumental music.] RACETRACK: Boomer! BOOMER: Come on, let's go! RACETRACK: What took you so long? BOOMER: Go! RACETRACK: Where's your helmet? Go back. Don't turn around. [Ship rumbling.] [Beeping.] [Ominous instrumental music.] He put his weapon right to my head. Said to tell you he was following his instincts whatever the hell that means. ADAMA: Bring him here. TIGH: What about Roslin? We put her in the brig. Dradis contacts! It's Boomer and Racetrack, sir. Put them on the speakers. BOOMER: [On PA system.] Galactica, Boomer. Mission accomplished. Repeat: Mission accomplished. The base star is history! [All cheering and clapping.] There's some good news. Bring them home, D. It's good to hear your voice, Boomer. Come on home. [Starbuck groaning.] [Starbuck exclaiming in pain.] HELO: It's okay. I can't believe it. You are like the last person I expected to see. [Starbuck panting heavily.] I could say the same thing about you. - You okay? - Yeah, thank you. [Starbuck exclaiming in pain.] I missed you. Hey, I [Starbuck panting hysterically.] STARBUCK: She's a Cylon! HELO: No! You can't! She's pregnant. [Screaming.] No! [Light orchestral music.] - I know this place. - Of course you do. Go inside. [Orchestral music swells.] I don't understand. Life has a melody, Gaius. A rhythm of notes that become your existence once they're played in harmony with God's plan. It's time to do your part and realise your destiny. Which is what, exactly? You are the guardian and protector of the new generation of God's children. The first member of our family will be with us soon, Gaius. It's time to make your choice. But I don't understand what you're talking about. I don't understand. Come. See the face of the shape of things to come. [Orchestral music continues.] Isn't she beautiful, Gaius? [Baltar exclaiming in wonder.] Open the cell. Close the cell. MARINE: Well done, Lieutenant. BOOMER: Thanks. GAETA: Hey, nice work. BOOMER: Thanks. What's going on? GAETA: A lot happened while you were gone. GAETA: Congrats. BOOMER: Thanks. Congratulations to both of you. You carried out a very difficult and dangerous mission and you did it despite any personal misgivings you may or may not have had. And for that, I'm very proud. ADAMA: Thank you. RACETRACK: Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. [Gripping instrumental music.] [Haunting music.] APOLLO: Someone get a doctor! [Alarm blaring.] Hold his head. [Sombre instrumental music.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] DUALLA: Radiological alarm! TIGH: From where? The Olympic Carrier, sir. They've got nukes on board. If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat. The Cylons will be here any second. If we're gonna do this, then just do it. - It's a civilian ship. - Do it. - Giving up my seat. - Like hell. [Tense instrumental music.] HELO: Sharon? What are you doing here? BOOMER: Let's move, mister. [Eerie instrumental music.] [Gasps.] [Tense instrumental music.] - Excuse me, Lieutenant. - Specialist. Good evening. - Sir? - Is something wrong? No, sir. It's just morning, sir. - What time is it? - 0545. [Electronic beeping.] [Gasps.] [Tense instrumental music.] BOOMER: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. BOOMER: Where are the rest of them? [Beeping.] [Beeping intensifies.] [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Theme music.] GAETA: Attention. Colonial One will arrive in 30 minutes. GAETA: Honour detail report in quarters. TIGH: Where the hell is it? Damned son of a sash. I heard you the first time! TIGH: One. Two. Three. Four. Five. [Dramatic instrumental music.] ROSLIN: Do it. APOLLO: I can't stop thinking about the Olympic Carrier. That was three days ago. It's ancient history under these circumstances. Leave the second-guessing to the historians. But don't we have a responsibility? I mean, as leaders, don't we have an obligation to question our actions to I don't know. To make sure the decisions we make are the right decisions. We did what we had to do, Son. A man takes responsibility for his actions, right or wrong. He accepts the consequences and lives with them every day. [Slow instrumental music.] LSO: Colonial One, Galactica. Proceed to Omega Docking. Contact CIC when you have hard seal. PILOT: Roger that, Galactica. BILLY: Excuse me, Madam President. We've arrived Please don't tell me that we have to go through this every time I step on that ship. No, ma'am. But they will always render honours for your arrival. It's protocol. The military, they do love their protocol. I'm sure if they knew you didn't like it, they'd be willing to ROSLIN: No. Let Adama sound the trumpets. It makes him feel more comfortable. Maybe if he feels more comfortable - he'll be a little easier to deal with. - That's smart. No, it's not smart. It's politics. ROSLIN: I think I'm going to get tired of this outfit. Seeing as I only have three for the rest of my life. - That looks fine. - Fine? It looks great. You don't know anything about women, do you? - Shall we? - Let's go be "presidential." I am confident that I speak for the entire fleet when I say thank you. Without your extraordinary dedication, your tireless effort, your sacrifice no one of us would be here today. I'm proud to serve as your President. Thank you. [All clapping.] Carry on. Sir, the Virgon Express is manoeuvring alongside. - They're standing by for unrep. - Thank you very much, D. Officer of the Watch, you'll proceed with the unrep, please. Aye, sir. ADAMA: If you'll step this way. ROSLIN: Thank you. - Excuse me, Chief. A word with you, please. - Just one second. You know what? Just let's do it. What's up? Got a problem. TYROL: Yes, sir, Lieutenant, sir. TYROL: I believe the navcon modules are ready for inspection. DUALLA: Virgon Express, Galactica. We have you in visual contact. Maintain current course and speed. PILOT: Roger that, Galactica. Maintain current course and speed. Powering up stabilisation gyros Galactica's water recycling system is close to 100% effective. For all intents and purposes, there's not a drop of water that's wasted aboard. ADAMA: We have enough water for several years before replenishing. - I see. - Many of the ships like the Virgon Express were not made for long-term voyages - and will have to tank off of us periodically. - Right. Whatever it is, we're gonna take care of it, okay? You all right? Now, tell me what happened. What's going on? There are at this moment six G-4 detonators missing from the small-arms locker on Deck 15. Commander, ready to extend the water boom. Excuse me. TIGH: How's it going? ADAMA: Oh, boy, I feel like a - Tour guide? - It shows? Well, she was a teacher. Probably sees all this as one big educational experience. - He thinks I'm a total idiot, doesn't he? - What? No, sir. No. It's all right. What are you telling me for? If munitions go missing, you got to tell the master-at-arms now! BOOMER: I know that! You can't screw around with stuff like this! I'm not screwing around, okay? The only reason I didn't tell anybody is 'cause they're gonna think I'm the one who took them. How are things? DUALLA: Things are good. BILLY: Good. You look good. I really like your hair. My hair? [Chuckling.] I don't know anything about women. Madam President, if I may? I think you should know that my father - Well, this entire ceremony was his idea. - I know. I think he's enjoying it. Actually, he hates protocol, pomp, and all that. - Really? - He's making a gesture. Trying to make you feel like the President. Open Valves 3 and 5. [Rumbling.] BOOMER: I took the one detonator from the duffel, replaced it and then I went back to my quarters. Well [Tyrol clears throat.] You know what? It's not your fault. Someone's obviously setting you up to take the fall for something. That's what it is. You wake up somewhere, you don't know how you got there. You're drugged, or manipulated, or who knows what. Something. [Tense instrumental music.] What do we do? Because if I report what's happened, they'll think I'm a Cylon agent. No, they're not. No. Why would they think that? That's crazy. People are getting crazy, okay? You've heard the rumours. Cylons who look like humans, sleeper agents hiding in the fleet. [Rumbling.] [Alarm blaring.] Decompression alarm! [Dramatic instrumental music.] ADAMA: Damage report, Mr. Gaeta. Ruptures in Tanks 3, 5, 7, 9. TIGH: Strain on the unrep lines. They're gonna blow. Release the lines. Veer away, starboard! Every tank on the port side has ruptured. We're venting all our water directly into space. [Dramatic instrumental music.] CIC, it's DC One. We're entering the tank. DUALLA: Roger that, DC One. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Raptor 478, DC One. I have you in my sights. Copy that, DC One, I have you in sight. TYROL: Understood. How's it look in there? Can you tell what happened? Lieutenant, don't worry about my team. I've got things under control. Copy that, DC One. I feel better knowing you're on it. Watch the light, you're off target. How much water did we lose? Ten million JPs, sir. Almost 60% of total potable water reserves. Emergency rations. Shut down laundry, showers, anything nonessential immediately. Yes, sir. - How long will our water supplies last? - Aboard Galactica, about six days. But one-third of the other ships in the fleet were depending on us for replenishment. If we don't find new supplies they'll run out of water in two days. One-third? That's 16,000 people. Get the names of those ships. Tell their captains to go on emergency rations immediately. There's gonna be riots in those ships. Civilians don't like hearing they can't take a bath, wash their clothes - or drink more than a thimble a day. - Thank you for the warning, Colonel. - That'll be all, Mr. Gaeta. - One more thing. Lieutenant? Do you have any theories about what may have caused the accident? There are many theories at this point, Madam President. Do you have a guess? I tell my officers not to guess. I prefer to wait until we have fact. Um-hm. Indulge me. Take a guess, Mr. Gaeta. I'd have to say the most likely explanation is that the tank was structurally weakened during the Cylon nuclear detonation during the first attack, and that caused it to buckle and rupture. GAETA: But it's too early to say. Sir. ROSLIN: Interesting. - Thank you, Lieutenant. - Back to the matter at hand. I've ordered an astronomical survey of nearby stars systems - for potential water sources. Colonel? - Yes, sir. [Eerie instrumental music.] Chief, take a look at this. TYROL: What do you got? CALLY: Not sure. CALLY: It looks like burn marks from an explosive. CALLY: What do you think? Umm [Stammering.] It's tough to tell. It's pretty rusted out. Optical and x-ray telescopes say there are five systems within our practical jump radius. All five have planetary bodies with the potential for finding water in either a liquid or a frozen state. Put together a plan for Raptors to scout each star system. - I want the first launch at 17:30. - Yes, sir. Colonel, how likely are we to find water on any of these planets? Now you want me to guess, I take it. - Colonel. - Sir. My apologies, Madam President. Difficult day for everyone. I understand. Most planets are just hunks of rock or balls of gas. The galaxy's a pretty barren, desolate place when you get right down to it. ADAMA: Thank you, Colonel. ROSLIN: The water rationing'll make our supply problem worse. ROSLIN: Dr. Baltar, please share the results of your study. I've calculated the rate of consumption regarding basic foodstuffs for the civilian population. BALTAR: This is based on information available to me at the time. The current civilian population of 45,265 will require, at minimum - and 2.5 million JPs of water. - Is that per month? Per week. [Thunder rumbling.] HELO: They found your Raptor. A few or a lot? HELO: That's what you get for coming back for me. BOOMER: Frack. HELO: Yeah. I was sure they didn't track me coming in. - I know. - I set the jiggers to pulse. HELO: I'm sure you did. I didn't set off any detection grids, any dradis sweeps, or pingers. - Never send a pilot to do an ECO's job. - I can do your job. I guess that's why the toasters are crawling all over our ride out of here. HELO: I don't suppose there's a Plan B. Plans B, C, D and E are the same as Plan A. Get off the planet and get back to the ship. Come on. Where are we going? BOOMER: Don't ask questions. Just follow your pilot. Yes, sir. Umm So far we've found five discrete detonation points in the tank and we believe that there may be a sixth. I've suspected due to the size of the residual scoring and the burn points that we are dealing with a G-4 type explosive. So I've requested a spot check of all inventory from the master-at-arms and she indicated to me that there are six detonators missing from a small-arms locker in the port flight pod. So one detonator may still be unaccounted for. Have the master-at-arms post guards at all small-arms lockers immediately. It's already done, sir. She also has opened an investigation into who may have had access to that locker. However, due to spotty record-keeping and lax internal security procedures since the attack she believes that we may never know who took the detonators. [Tense instrumental music.] [Both whispering.] ADAMA: Chief, thank you very much. Everyone except for Col. Tigh, Capt. Adama, and Dr. Baltar are now released. ADAMA: Please remember: this briefing is strictly confidential. [Door closes.] There is at least one Cylon aboard the Galactica. [Tense instrumental music continues.] How many people know the Cylons look human? The rumour mill's been working overtime. Half the ship's talking about it. There'll always be rumours. For most people, that's all they'll ever be. I'm asking how many people actually know? TIGH: The five people in this room, plus three Marines. ROSLIN: Let's keep it that way. Once this gets out officially people will be accusing each other of being Cylons for no reason at all. I agree. Dr. Baltar, how're we doing on the screenings? The screenings? You were supposed to be screening Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents. NO. 6: Do you remember the first time you lied to a woman? Other than your mother, that is. BALTAR: Other than my mother. Sherry Bennett. Fourth grade. On the playground, behind the band room. "If you show me yours, I'll show you mine." She did. I did not. You know, I think I slept with her actually, many years later, of course. NO. 6: Of course. [Tense instrumental music.] NO. 6: Did she turn out to be a beautiful woman? As a matter of fact, she did. Very beautiful. But every woman has her beauty her feminine charms that are hers and hers alone. ADAMA: Doctor? Doctor? BALTAR: The screenings. To tell you the truth, there are significant problems with implementing my Cylon detection method that I used aboard Galactica previously and basically because I've run out of natural resources. I need chemical compounds. For example, the precursor test. I need large samples of tetrahydrocycline which I don't have to tell you Maybe I do have to. BALTAR: It's a highly volatile chemical ADAMA: Let me stop you there. Your intellect obviously outstrips everyone in this room. But it's also obvious by the way that you're talking that in order to make large-scale screenings you're going to need help, staff, resources. Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Exactly. Although, more staff? Someone snooping around, watching your every move? Maybe it'll be a woman, you could find her secret beauty. ADAMA: I'm going to assign Lt. Gaeta to aid you in anything that you might need. So much for that. But the need for secrecy? Clearly, this falls into the "absolutely necessary" category. Your screening techniques may be critical to our very survival. Humanity's very survival rests in your hands. Now, if only you had an actual Cylon detector. APOLLO: This is a critical mission. APOLLO: Fights have already broken out on some ships over the rations. There's panic in the air. You don't find water out there and find it soon - I understand, Captain. We'll find it. - Good hunting. APOLLO: Hey, Chief. TYROL: Captain. - Lieutenant. - Chief. I feel like my head's about to explode. TYROL: Just relax, calm down. Focus on the mission. We'll take care of everything when you get back. BOOMER: What about the investigation? Master-at-arms is running it. Don't worry, there's no connection to you. In fact, there's no reason to believe you had anything to do with it at all. BOOMER: I didn't. TYROL: I know. - I would never do something like that. Never. - Sharon, I know. It's really important you believe me on this. - You do believe me, right? - Absolutely. TYROL: Yes, sir. BOOMER: Thank you, Chief. Carry on. Please excuse me for keeping you waiting. I was called into the engine room. It'll just take a moment. ROSLIN: That's all right. Sometime I'd like to borrow a book or two. I only brought one with me on the flight to Galactica. ADAMA: What book? ROSLIN: A Murder on Picon. ROSLIN: I have a weakness for mystery. ADAMA: Ever read Dark Day? Edward Prima. I am embarrassed to say it's one of those classics I've never gotten around to reading. I think you'll enjoy it. Thank you. [Soft instrumental music.] It may be a while before I get this back to you. It's a gift. Never lend books. Well, then thank you for the gift. I'm really looking forward to working with you, Doctor. - You have a friend. - As am I, Lieutenant. I actually studied genetics in college. I was planning on going for my graduate degree through the military extension program. Wonderful. Is that a card game? And the girl wins again. Another round? Come on, guys. Grace under pressure. Nothing like losing a little money to take your mind off those 14-hour patrols. - Mind if I sit in, Lieutenant? - lf you got the cubits, we've got the chair. Of course if you've got anything to drink, we'll take that in lieu of cash. You know I don't have any money, but this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits. It's made of the finest Caprican cloth, warm in winter, cooling in summer. It'd look great on you. Anybody else got any civilian clothes they'd be interested in putting on the table? [Rapping on table.] Don't let me keep you. Col. Tigh was right. Rioting broke out on a cruise ship when they reduced water rations. We need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order. We need to do it now. We don't have extra manpower for fleet security. You have the only armed, disciplined force available. Yeah, but I'm not going to be your policeman. There's a reason why you separate military and the police. One fights the enemy of the state. The other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both then the enemies of the state tend to become the people. I appreciate the complexity of the issue and I won't let that happen. - I'll send troops to the cruise ship. - Commander, I won't let that happen. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] - Beginning dradis one sweep. - Beginning dradis two sweep. So I'm thinking we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name. - I'm thinking "Kimiko." - "Kimiko"? After a lovely little lady, in a lovely little city, in a lovely little colony - that I used to know. - Whatever. [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Electronic beeping.] [Music intensifies.] Sorry. So sorry. You had such a good run, though. Looks like the bet's to me. BALTAR: I'll try and muddle through for another round. I'm going to raise you five. No guts, no glory, Doctor. I'll see your five and raise you 20. Now it's just you and me. I'm not used to playing in this kind of high-stakes game. STARBUCK: It's not too late to bow out. Now there's an excellent suggestion. And before proceeding any further I should really examine my motivations for doing so. Staying in the game, I run the risk of losing my entire stake and being humiliated in front of these lovely people. "Humiliated" is a such a strong word. "Embarrassed" would be my choice. You do play rough, don't you? STARBUCK: A little too rough for you. My hand's not that strong. It wouldn't take much to knock me out of the game. Well, thank you, Doctor. [Starbuck giggling.] However, without a little risk life would be so dull, wouldn't it? Calling. [Clears throat.] Three on a run. BALTAR: Full colours. [Pilots cheering.] Thank you all for a most pleasant evening. A parting gift. BALTAR: Hand-rolled from some of the finest fumarello leaf in Caprica. And it's also one of the last left in the universe. Thank you. My pleasure. [Baltar coughing.] Excuse me. The Raptors have reported back after three star systems. - So far, all report negative for water, sir. - I just checked with Astrometrics. They're coming up with big goose eggs. There's no star systems within the range of our telescopes with planetary bodies likely to have water on them. Sir. Another Raptor just checked in. Negative on water as well. ADAMA: Who's left? DUALLA: Boomer and Crashdown, sir. If they come up negative as well what's our back-up plan? We'll jump to another sector and start the search all over again. - Needle in a haystack. - More like grain of salt on a beach. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Still nothing and more nothing. I got nothing here, either. CRASHDOWN: Then that's it. Five moons, five zeroes. I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it. Hope somebody else has more luck out there. Yeah. CRASHDOWN: What's on your mind, Boomer? I don't know. I have this feeling. - Let's run that last sweep again. - You're the boss. - Beginning sweep 21. - Beginning sweep 22. CRASHDOWN: Boomer, I'm getting nothing again. How about you? [Tense instrumental music.] BOOMER: I'm having trouble saying it. CRASHDOWN: What do you mean? [Tense instrumental music continues.] I think I see Oh! I have positive contact! Yeah! [Tense music reaches crescendo.] Oh, yes! Yeah! Good call, Boomer. Sir. Dradis just picked up Boomer's Raptor. ADAMA: Let's hear it. CRASHDOWN: Galactica, Crashdown. Dradis sweeps indicate it's time to break out the swimsuits because we've found water! Repeat: Positive water contact! [Crew cheering.] Patch me in to the entire fleet. You're connected, sir. Attention. This is the commander. We have found water! [Dramatic instrumental music.] Let's go have a drink. I think they're pleased. I can hear them screaming in the background. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Thunder rumbling.] HELO: Sharon, be careful with that needle. We're running low on anti-radiation medicine. - Not really Mom's home cooking. - Yeah? It beats eating grass and leaves. We'll be cooking up a fine meal of twigs and moss by the end of the week. You spoil me. Can I ask you something, Sharon? Why'd you come back for me? I hate to fly alone. Come on. You disobeyed orders, flew back into this hellhole and not that I don't appreciate it, but why? I just couldn't leave you behind. Let's leave it at that. [Signal beeping.] It's a Colonial Fleet signal. I can't decode it, but it means there's someone. Someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in Caprica. Yes! [Soft instrumental music.] Now all we have to do is find them. [All cheering.] - Way to go, Boomer! - Nice work, sir! - Nice job. Let's get you debriefed. - Yes, sir. Chief. You think you could take a look at my ejection pyros? BOOMER: I think there's a short. TYROL: Yeah. Cally. No, Chief. You could take a look at it yourself. [Dramatic instrumental music.] ROSLIN: Thank you for coming, Capt. Apollo. I am aware that you were in charge of the mission that destroyed the Olympic Carrier. ROSLIN: I know what a hard thing that is to live with, for all of us. ROSLIN: I'm struggling with it myself, frankly. APOLLO: I can't stop thinking about it. [Sombre instrumental music.] But a man has to accept responsibility for his actions. He doesn't second-guess the choices he makes. He lives with them. Every day. You know, I remember when President Adar sent the Marines into Aerilon. ROSLIN: Fifteen people died. ROSLIN: In public, of course, he had to say all the usual things. He was sure of what he'd done, he made the right choice he stayed the course. But he knew it was a mistake. ROSLIN: And he kept the names of the dead in his desk drawer. He said that it was imperative for a leader to remember and learn from the mistakes even if they can't admit to them publicly. - You think we made a mistake? - I don't know. ROSLIN: I don't have a desk drawer yet, but I have a pocket. ROSLIN: I don't want to add to your burdens, however. I have a request. I would like you to be my personal military advisor. I'm sorry. My father is the senior military officer. He should advise you. No, I don't mean to go behind your father's back. Nothing like that. I'm not looking for military advice. I'm looking for advice about the military. ROSLIN: That little insight about your father making a gesture, that really helped me. It made me reassess the man. I would appreciate more of those insights. And you can keep your day job at the C-A-G. It's pronounced "CAG." Do you see why I need you? So who's going to tell my father? Well I was thinking that that would be your first assignment. Somehow I knew you were going to say that. Thank you, Captain. Hey. BOOMER: That is just what I needed. TYROL: Oh, yeah? - Did you find that detonator? - Yes, I did. - I gave it to master-at-arms. - What? TYROL: No, no. I told her I found it during maintenance. Listen, calm down. This is the best way to go about this. Okay? That puts them on the same trail we're on and it doesn't raise any suspicion of you. Listen. Trust me on this, Sharon. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Okay? - Okay. - All right, okay. TYROL: Don't worry, sweetie. - I better go. - All right. [Man's voice on PA system.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Gunshot.] [No. 6 gasps.] HELO: What the hell is going on? You killed her. We gotta go. Right now. BILLY: That's Tom Zarek. DUALLA: The terrorist? BILLY: He's a prisoner of conscience. DUALLA: He's a butcher. He blew up a government building, there is no excuse for that. I thought you said you respected me. That was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking. ZAREK: I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers. I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership. If you let the rest of these hostages go, we will leave this ship in your hands. McMANUS: Got it? MAN: Test. There. McMANUS: Are we on? MAN: Frack, we're on. Go. McMANUS: Live from Cloud Nine, the most luxurious ship in the fleet it's The Colonial Gang. It's a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleet. I'm James McManus, formerly of the Caprica Times. With me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left. Playa Palacios, veteran commentator for the Picon Star Tribune. Welcome. And my wingman, Sekou Hamilton, former editor of the Aerilon Gazette. McMANUS: [On radio.] As most people know Cloud Nine was damaged during a Cylon attack and had to be evacuated. With repairs now complete, President Roslin has picked it as the site for an historic gathering. It's the first meeting of the Interim Quorum of 12 which will coincide with Colonial Day the 52nd anniversary of the signing of the Articles of Colonisation. Playa, why don't you weigh in? Laura Roslin should be applauded for restoring the system of checks and balances. McMANUS: Every delegate chosen so far has been a Roslin crony. It's a puppet Quorum, okay? That will rubber-stamp every edict this power-mad schoolteacher will try How can you say that when half the Quorum hasn't even been selected? McMANUS: I predict every one of them will be a Roslin lackey hand-picked by the power behind the throne, Presidential Advisor, Wallace Gray. Don't you see, Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt. Come on, Jim. Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness. I disagree. He's helped Roslin regulate the internal economy made sure vital food and medical supplies were fairly distributed He's a gasbag who's made a fortune through deals Quorum members have profited from. ROSLIN: Freedom of the press. McMANUS: As we speak Madam President, the fatuous gasbag would like 5 minutes of your time. Wally. ROSLIN: How does it feel to be a celebrity? GRAY: Well, I love it. They'll probably be calling me a fascist next. No, I'm the fascist. You stick with being the gasbag. Madam President, excuse me, you're going to want to hear this. McMANUS:  Sagittaron have chosen their delegate for the Interim Quorum of 12. Who would've guessed it? Tom Zarek. - Oh, my gods. - He's got quite a following out there. - I should have seen this coming. - He's a terrorist. Who are they kidding? McMANUS:  a ruthless terrorist. HAMILTON: Tom Zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape. He blew up a government building and now he's gonna sit on the Quorum of 12? McMANUS: Wrong. The government trumped up charges to discredit a man who's dedicated his life for the disenfranchised. Yes? Just a moment. Commander Adama. Why am I not surprised? ROSLIN: Hello, Commander. ADAMA: Are you listening to this? - Indeed. - Can't allow a terrorist to sit in government. ROSLIN: My hands are tied. I don't want to turn him into a martyr. Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he's served his time. Tom Zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet. I can bar him from travelling to Cloud Nine on that basis alone. I perfectly understand the threat Tom Zarek represents. But the last thing I need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad. We need to let this play out. Thank you. McMANUS: [On radio.] Hold onto your shorts. There's another story. We're getting a live feed from the Astral Queen. Tom Zarek is about to make a statement. ZAREK: Citizens of the 12 Colonies, I am humbled and moved by this great honour. I will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful that turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor. But Roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us. ZAREK: [On radio.] People of the fleet, look up. The winds of change are blowing. A new era is about to dawn. [Theme music.] Hey, Doc. Lt. Thrace, to what do I owe this honour? Our shuttle leaves for Cloud Nine at 05:12 tomorrow, so don't be late. "Our" shuttle? A surprise getaway? Just the two of you? - I'm going to be handling your security. - Please don't touch that. Thank you. BALTAR: Security for what? STARBUCK: You haven't heard? It's all over talk wireless. When would I have the chance to listen to talk wireless? I have 60 years of work in front of me. Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse for lowbrow rabble-rousing. You've been selected as Caprica's delegate to the Quorum of 12. Me? Is this some kind of joke? Guess you got the super-genius vote. No accounting for taste. STARBUCK: Congratulations, Doctor. BALTAR: Thank you. Politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples. All those interminable speeches. All that dreary pomp. Parties full of young women drawn to men of power. [Climactic instrumental music.] But when the people call, you must serve. APOLLO: I can't remember the last time I felt the sunlight on my face. Sure feels good. Almost like the real thing. [Birds chirping.] STARBUCK: They could've done a better job with the horizon, though. Security's going to be a bitch. A thousand different places for a sniper to hide. How many people are we dealing with? APOLLO: Five hundred plus. APOLLO: Each colony's sending a delegation of leading citizens. Great. Herds of lookie-loos, any one of whom could be a Cylon. APOLLO: Toasters aren't our only problem. Don't you pay any attention to politics? - No. - A lot of unrest out there. So why is Roslin insisting on letting so many people come? I guess she thinks it's important to them to be able to observe how their government works. So basically, she's already running for re-election. APOLLO: No, Kara. [Apollo screaming.] APOLLO: Kara, give me that. [Both laughing heartily.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] SECURITY AGENT: Thank you, sir. Enjoy your day. PALACIOS: The atmosphere is electric as Quorum members arrive with their delegations. I'm outside the Cloud Nine Ballroom where the reception of the new Quorum of 12 will take place. The question is, will President Roslin shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist or will she snub him, and by extension, all the people of Sagittaron? Col. Tigh. - My wife Ellen. - Welcome aboard. Kill me now. [Ellen clears throat.] Col. Tigh. [Suspenseful instrumental music continues.] APOLLO: Starbuck, Apollo. Zarek's here. STARBUCK: Copy. STARBUCK: Don't worry. This guy's mine the second he makes a wrong move. APOLLO: [On wireless.] Yeah? Well, you'll have to beat me to him. Murderer. You don't belong here, Zarek. Go back. GRIMES: What did you say? He's not a murderer, he's a freedom fighter. GRIMES: All right? APOLLO: Excuse me. - May I see your security pass, sir? - Not a problem. I'm a citizen of Sagittaron. I've got every legal right to be here. Your rights don't extend to roughing people up. Lay a hand on anyone else and you'll be getting to know Galactica's brig. APOLLO: Well, everything's in order. Enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine. Oh, I will. [Tense instrumental music.] ZAREK: Tom Zarek. TIGH: Col. Tigh, Battlestar Galactica. I see. My wife. - Does she have a name? - Ellen. ZAREK: Call me Tom. I don't like to stand on ceremony. I'm the same way. All this pretension makes me sick. You're holding up the line. Thank you for making me feel welcome, Ellen. I hope to see you again. Why did you do that? To get our picture on the front page of every newsletter and photo service in the fleet. I don't need my picture taken with a terrorist. Wake up, Saul. Look at these cameras. [Ellen giggles pretentiously.] Roslin's the past, Zarek's the future. A blind man can see that. ZAREK: Madam President. ROSLIN: Mr. Zarek. If I were to offer you my hand in friendship would you take it? Well, there's only one way to find out. [Cameras clicking.] [Crowd chattering.] ZAREK: That was nicely played. ROSLIN: Thank you. Just remember, I'm not your enemy, Madam President. ROSLIN: And I know today's agenda is rather large but I think that if you'll look at the scheduled meetings you'll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet. In some cases, existing policies regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies NO. 6: You're missing an intriguing opportunity. Playa's not wearing any underwear. Don't be absurd. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Really? She's been eyeing you all afternoon. She's certainly human. You're not jealous? NO. 6: Love isn't about sex, Gaius. That's an enlightened point of view. I've been thinking as far as I'm concerned you can have any woman you want. But always remember I have your heart. Yes. Of course you do. I can always rip it out of your chest if I need to. [Baltar coughs.] ROSLIN: So if there are no objections the Chair will entertain motions to accept today's agenda as proposed. I have an objection. [People murmuring.] The chair recognises Sagittaron. All the items on your agenda are important, I agree. Ration distribution, education, medical services, all very important. But I'm frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found. Really? Well, perhaps Mr. Zarek could enlighten us? The election of a vice-president. lf, gods forbid, anything should happen to you, Madam President we have no designated successor. The civilian branch of our government would be paralysed leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship. Sagittaron moves that the first item on the Quorum's agenda should be nominations for vice-president. [Tense instrumental music.] Second. - Second. - Second. [People murmuring.] Caprica seconds for various reasons which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now. But certainly, I think we can all agree that it'd be a good idea to have a successor. The motion has been moved and seconded. All those in favour of opening nominations for the vice-presidency, say aye. ALL: Aye. Aye. ROSLIN: The ayes have it. The floor is now open for nominations. The chair recognises Virgon. Now, there is only one man here who is willing to work for the betterment of people in this fleet. When I asked for his help he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and, hell, they were finished and gone while I was still waiting for the President's office to return my call. I nominate Tom Zarek. Thanks. [All murmuring.] [Gravel pounding.] Is there a second? Gemenon seconds the nomination. The nomination of Tom Zarek for the vice-presidency has been accepted. [All applauding.] The Chair will remain open for 72 hours for nominations. The session is now adjourned. [lntense instrumental music.] ROSLIN: Thomas Zarek is not going to be my vice-president. Six months until the presidential election. We could've handpicked a candidate. It didn't shock me when Bagot nominated him. - But Porter, that was surprising. - Not really. The Gemenon ships use more water per capita than any other ship. She wanted more rations, I said no. Zarek may have made some friends in the last few weeks but there are still plenty who hate him. Don't underestimate Zarek. He's charismatic and knows what buttons to push. Frankly, Madam President, I am concerned about the security aboard Cloud Nine. ROSLIN: I want you leaning forward on this, Captain. ROSLIN: If they even sneeze, they better have a handkerchief. Understood. We need a candidate. Someone who will quickly win the delegates' support. An established name. I'm not a politician. ROSLIN: But you know how to get things done. You've kept this fleet functioning all this time. No. Thanks, but I can't allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, Wally. ROSLIN: I need you. You've got me, Madam President. How can you reassure people that you're looking out for their interests as opposed to the rehabilitation of Tom Zarek? That's a great question, Playa. This is how I see it. We're facing a situation so unique, so specific that I believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking. Like blowing up a building or two? ZAREK: If things weren't so serious, I'd say that was funny. Look, there's no economy. There's no market. No industry. No capital. Money is worthless. And yet, we're all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be. ZAREK: Look where we are. ZAREK: This man wakes up every morning tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden. ZAREK: [On radio.] Why? Because it's his job? What job? He labours, but he gets no benefit from his labour. He's not the only one. Many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives. The lawyers still act like lawyers, but they have no clients. [On radio.] Businessmen still act like businessmen, but have no business. President Roslin and her policies are all about holding on to a fantasy. [On radio.] If we want to survive, we need to completely restructure our lives. We need to think about the community of citizens. The group, not the individual. We need to completely free ourselves of the past and operate as a collective. You're not interested in the citizens. You just want power. Turn that crap off. I was listening to that broadcast. APOLLO: You again? That's a shame. They want to hear Mr. Zarek speak, too. Don't you, buddy? See? He wants to hear Mr. Zarek. How about you? You want to hear what Mr. Zarek has to say? I don't mind one way or the other. Well, I take that as a yes. So turn it on. - Now. - Leave it. Mr. Zarek is a representative of the people and we are the people. Well, you're people. Sort of. GRIMES: You know, I don't like your tone, flyboy so why don't you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather? I'd be happy to, after you leave. [Tense instrumental music.] Which is now. GRIMES: Okay. Don't want no trouble. [Apollo grunts.] STARBUCK: What the hell. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] [Both grunting.] [Starbuck grunting.] [Groaning and grunting.] [Both grunting.] STARBUCK: There's a gun. [Apollo groaning in pain.] Starbuck. STARBUCK: Incoming. [Starbuck grunts.] [Both exclaiming.] APOLLO: Are you looking for this? [Gun cocking.] [Starbuck panting heavily.] The Telamon Building's still standing. That's Delphi, all right. Now, all we have to do is wait until dark infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet hope the Cylons haven't completely wasted the spaceport steal a ship, locate Galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell. - Is that all? - Yeah. [Thunder rumbling.] I guess we can relax until dark. Might as well make ourselves comfortable. BOOMER: You hungry? HELO: No, not right now. HELO: Your stomach's feeling better? BOOMER: Starving. I'm trying to make sense out of the two women we saw with the Cylons. And? I can't fathom why anybody would wanna help the toasters. And they just happened to be twins? That's too weird. You got a better explanation? [Sober instrumental music.] You think the Cylons could be messing with human DNA? HELO: Cloning people or something? BOOMER: Could be. That would explain how they took us by surprise. They had these replicated humans infiltrating the colonies laying the groundwork for the surprise attack. You know, if they were human clones that means they're capable of complex emotions, maybe even love. Maybe they were misguided in the way that they were indoctrinated. Whatever they are, they're not human. No human could do the things they've done. Killed billions of innocent people. They've got to be fracking Cylons, just like the rest of them. Why do you have a summit itinerary? Why circle every public appearance by President Roslin? [Thudding.] It's not mine. Some stranger wandered down the hall, picked the lock to your room and left this? False-bottom with anechoic coating to absorb x-rays. [Screaming.] Ceramic stealth gun. You sure went through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard. I carry a lot of money. I need protection. APOLLO: Right. [Screaming.] The money's worthless. Your friend Zarek pointed that out. I don't even know Zarek. Your pal Grimes says different. He gave you up. You're bluffing. You haven't got anything. We don't need anything, Valance. Because this isn't a trial. This is just you and us in this room. STARBUCK: Like Zarek pointed out, we're living in a whole new world. No due process. This is your courtroom. And that would make us your executioners. STARBUCK: So you might want to cooperate, or else you're going out an air lock. Because that's what we do to traitors. VALANCE: Look, I I just came over here for the booze and the food. That's it. You know what? Frack you! APOLLO: We put all the heat on Valance we could but can't tie him to Zarek. I know Zarek's behind this. Keep working on Valance. We will. To be safe, I think you should send the Sagittaron delegation back. Can't. Violates their civil rights, plays right into Zarek's hands. He could have another shooter on Cloud Nine and if Zarek wins the vote, he's more than capable of ordering your assassination and ascending to the presidency. Zarek's not going to win because I'm not going to let him. Meanwhile, keep Zarek under surveillance, tap his phones, bug his room. If you find anything that remotely connects Zarek to Valance, shut him down. The domestic policies we've been talking about over the last little while such as employment, housing and education Latest vote count: seven for Gray, five for Zarek. We're slipping. He was four an hour ago. - Zarek must be making promises. - Picon flipped. ROSLIN: [Whispering.] We've got to hold the colonies till they vote tomorrow. GRAY: On Page 33 of my mission statement I lay out a 16-point educational programme that the President and I have developed. Individuals with four-year college degrees will be eligible. Hi. How are you doing? Remember me? We got Valance. And you're next. [Ominous instrumental music.] GRAY: Health care, it's one thing to talk ZAREK: Can I get you something? ELLEN: So you work here now? Why should I ask the bartender to get me a drink? - What's in it for him? - A big tip. What would he spend on? So, are you worried about Wallace Gray? I hear he's ahead in the vote count. Whatever the people want is fine by me. Everyone has an agenda. I know I do. ZAREK: And what would that be? The same as yours, Tom. Me. Myself. And I. [Light instrumental music playing.] You are clearly a well-connected, well-informed woman. ELLEN: Wife of the XO. For whatever that's worth. Quite a bit. Now and in the future. That's what I'm interested in, Tom. My place and my husband's place in the future. Okay. I'm looking for a friend of mine. His name is Valance. [Sinister instrumental music.] How the hell did this happen? We've got to get to the President. McMANUS: [On radio.] We're here with Dr. Gaius Baltar, representative of Caprica. Dr. Baltar, I had one question. Is President Roslin's political career terminal or is there hope of resuscitating it? BALTAR: Laura Roslin's political career is very much alive and to underestimate her would be a very serious mistake. - You miss the limelight, don't you, Gaius? - Yes, I have. - You have what, Dr. Baltar? - Nothing. You were saying? You seriously believe that this school teacher is able to handle the job of presidency? His wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room. - So was it suicide or was it murder? - It was no suicide. - Zarek had him killed. - lf only we could prove that. How'd they get past the Marine Guards? APOLLO: Through the vent. BALTAR: [On radio.] I'm glad to hear it because all of us have had teachers who made an impact on our lives. History is full of examples of leaders who have come from the most humble beginnings and have risen to meet the challenge posed by cataclysmic events. APOLLO: How many people knew where Valance was being held? STARBUCK: Just the people in this room plus two Marines. BALTAR:  criticise Roslin and the tough decisions she has to make every day. Especially, if you're someone like Tom Zarek who's never shouldered any real responsibility in your life. To be fair to Tom, he's been in prison for the last 20 years. And now that he's had a drastic personality makeover he's posing like he's the saviour to all your ills. I think you all have a short memory. Well, someone talked. And now we have no assassin, no evidence of a plot no check on Zarek, no nothing. If he can get to Valance, he can get to anyone. Madam President, he will definitely try and take a shot at you now. Only if he wins the vote. What I have to say is, we must survive. [On radio.] And we will survive. And we will do so through the values that have made our colonies great. Courage. Truth. Justice. Liberty. With a firm and deep resolve to make tomorrow better. Not just for ourselves, but for our children. [All applauding.] Madam President, I still worry the vote may be trending against you. ROSLIN: Yes, it is. But I'm going to win this thing. And Tom Zarek is going back to his prison ship where he belongs. ROSLIN: But first I have two very unpleasant duties to perform. I need a shuttle to Cloud Nine. What am I supposed to say? - Health reasons. - Oh, right, fine. Health reasons. You know, all those years I watched you working with Adar. You were always so quiet, so polite so dignified. I never thought you'd fit in with the bare-knuckled, backstabbing politicians. I guess I was wrong. All clear. Dr. Baltar? Are you in here? [Toilet flushing.] BALTAR: Madam President? I heard you on the wireless. You were very articulate, quite engaging. Oh, thank you. That's very encouraging. Yeah, I was just trying to do my bit as the elected representative of Caprica. Besides, I'm beginning to get a real feel for politics. So I take it you're not voting for Mr. Zarek? A man who uses his intelligence and resources to blow up buildings doesn't get my vote, no. No, I'm voting for your man Gray. He's really great. He is great, which is why he's got my vote. ROSLIN: Unfortunately Mr. Gray dropped out of the race. - Then who do you want me to vote for? - I was thinking you. Me? - Look - Doctor, let's cut to the chase. ROSLIN: You're a very popular man these days. ROSLIN: I would be fortunate to have your intellect and your popularity right by my side. Under those circumstances, I accept. BALTAR: Thank you, Madam President. ROSLIN: Thank you. Wow. What are you going to do now? Now I'm going to give you an exclusive. BALTAR: After you. So what are we supposed to do? Sit on our hands and watch her get killed? Zarek's too smart to take another shot at the President during the summit. If he wins the vote, he can take her out later when everyone's forgotten about Valance. He'll just bide his time to find a better opportunity. That's great. Anyway, she says she's not going to lose the vote. She says a lot of things. Don't you think you should wash that? STARBUCK: I did. APOLLO: Like when, a month ago? - Do you have a problem with my hygiene? - You have hygiene? I clean up good sometimes, all right? Well, let me know when it's one of those times. Tauron, Gaius Baltar. The surprises just keep on coming. A number of the Quorum delegates have now shifted their support to the scientific genius a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasions. At this point, Jim, it is anyone's guess as to who's going to win, but my money is on Gaius. Dr. Baltar. Aquaria, Thomas Zarek. [Tense instrumental music.] Aerilon: Tom Zarek. PALACIOS: The vote is now six-five in favour of Tom Zarek. The next vote will determine our new vice-president. If Zarek gets it, he wins. In the event of a tie, the President will cast the deciding vote. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] [All cheering.] Citizens I give you your new vice-president, Dr. Gaius Baltar. [Upbeat jazzy instrumental music playing.] [All applauding.] The perks of power, Mr. Vice-President. We're going to do great things together. Good. It's difficult to fathom. I never aspired to power. Of course you didn't, Gaius. But someone had to step up. - Well, after what Laura told me - Laura? BALTAR: Yeah, we're on a first name basis now. Now look, I think the people need me. Excuse us. [Music continues playing.] So that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good. And the other one's not too bad either. Lee, if you want to ask me to dance, just ask. You want to dance? Me in a dress is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. - Madam President. - Mr. Zarek. Oh, don't worry, I won't be kissing you today. That's a shame. I shaved very closely in anticipation of being smacked by you. That was very nicely played. Again. But there's still a presidential election in six months. - I'll see you then. - I have no doubt. Oh, one thing you should know. I didn't kill Valance. I wonder who did? [All applauding.] Madam President, good evening. I thought you hated these things. It's Colonial Day. Where else would I be? I'm a patriot. You really are, aren't you? ADAMA: Dr. Baltar. Interesting choice. I figured, the devil you know. Politics. As exciting as war. ADAMA: Definitely as dangerous. Though in war you only get killed once. In politics, it can happen over and over. You're still standing. So are you. And I can dance. [Music continues playing.] - I have a surprise for you. - Should I be worried? [Giggling mischievously.] Not unless you consider a day in a luxury suite aboard the Rising Star as something to be worried about. What? How did you swing that? I have my ways. [Ellen giggles.] [Ellen exclaims contentedly.] What you need to do is figure out a way to get slave-driving Bill to give you the day off. TIGH: [Chuckling.] Yeah. And while we're there, we might want to talk to a few people - about your future. - What? Later, my love. It can all wait until later. [Ominous instrumental music.] Any second now. [Both panting.] If we get caught If anything happens You don't have to say anything. I know. We're going to make it, Sharon. Okay? [Ship humming.] Okay. Go. [Tense instrumental music.] [Solemn instrumental music.] [Mysterious instrumental music.] [Muffled speech.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Gunshots.] [Gripping instrumental music.] [Gunshot.] Sharon? We're still alive. Why nobody else? You never get tired. Trust me. Helo, come with me. Helo. Helo. [Exclaiming in despair.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. BALTAR: Now you tell me you're a machine. The robot. You knew I wanted access to defence mainframe. Do you have any idea what they'd do to me if they find out? NO. 6: Get down. [Glass shattering.] ADAMA: Moments ago, this ship received word that the Cylon attack against our home worlds is underway. As of this moment, we are at war. All right, we can take three more people. Giving up my seat. [Tense instrumental music.] I've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states. So I'm in your head? [Tense instrumental music.] No. There're maybe Cylon agents living among us. Some may not even know they're Cylons at all. They could be sleeper agents programmed to perfectly impersonate human beings until activation. [Clock ticking.] [lntense instrumental music.] [Tense instrumental music.] [Electronic beeping.] And one minute to mark. [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Electronic beeping.] [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Electronic beeping.] [Tense instrumental music continues.] God has a plan for you, Gaius. He has a plan for everything and everyone. Gaius? Are you even listening to me? [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] PILOT: Passengers, 30 seconds to mark. ROSLIN: Planet. Men. Women. Age. You know what? Do this after the jump. It's all right. [Sighs.] [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Clock ticking.] You have to believe in something. BALTAR: I believe in a world that I can and do understand. A rational universe. Explained through rational means. I love you. That's not rational. [Tense instrumental music continues.] I know. No, but you're not rational. You're also not really here. Neither am I. [Doorbell rings.] PILOT: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen our 33 minutes are almost up once again. Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump. Thank you. [Clock ticking.] Cutting it a little close this time, aren't we, Billy? Pilot says he's had to reboot the FTL computer again. [Tense instrumental music.] CALLY: Why do the Cylons come every 33 minutes? Why isn't it 34, 35 TYROL: Cally. CALLY: What? Shut up. [Tense instrumental music continues.] Fifteen seconds. Sir, Jump 237 underway. Fifty-three ships have jumped. Ten still reporting trouble with their FTL drives including Colonial One. We're getting slower. [Electronic beeping.] Maybe this time. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] [Beeping.] [Rapid electronic beeping.] [Alarm ringing.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] GAETA: Dradis contact. It's the Cylons. - Damn it. - Not this time, maybe the next. Got another idea for the next cycle. PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid the Cylons have appeared again. However, our FTL drive is now working and we will jump momentarily. BALTAR: Five days now. [Tense instrumental music.] There are limits to the human body, the human mind. Tolerances that you can't push beyond. Well, those are facts provable facts. Everyone has a limit. All right, you know the drill, people. Scatter formation. APOLLO: Keep them off the civies and don't stray beyond the recovery line. [Guns firing.] Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns. You've got a red light right there. [Electronic crackling.] [Rapid beeping.] DUALLA: We have a hit on the starboard bow. Away the damage control parties. Basestar is launching raiders. [Tense instrumental music.] Colonial One is ready to jump. All civilian ships away, including Colonial One. Recover fighters. Stand by to jump. Combat landings. [Tense instrumental music continues.] - All fighters aboard, sir. - Execute jump. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] Jump 237 complete. All civilian ships present and accounted for, sir. TIGH: Start the clock. And let's start prepping for the next jump. Clock is running. Thirty-three minutes. Mark. TYROL: You have 32 minutes, people. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Sighing.] NO. 6: You know you're not safe. No, of course not. The Cylons will follow us again as they have the last 237 times. NO. 6: You're right, you know. There are limits. - Eventually, you'll make a mistake. - And then you'll kill us all. Yes. Yes, I know. But not for another 33 minutes. [Clock ticking.] [Theme music.] [Tense instrumental music.] [Clock ticking.] ADAMA: I want to try something new this time. Divide the fleet into six groups. And they jump [Adama sighs.] ADAMA: And they jump two more times and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates. TIGH: Twenty-four jumps to plot, we're breaking our humps calculating one jump every 33 minutes. Get off my jacket. - You eating this? - Not anymore. APOLLO: Combat landings expected again to be the order of the day so double-check your undercarriage before Look, you all have done this 237 times. You know what to do. No mistakes. And let's make it to 238. Good luck and be careful out there. [Solemn instrumental music.] Can you do me a favour? Tell Capt. Apollo he owes me one wing. DAVE: You got it, dude. No, Cally, there's three. I know there's three. - Can you check it again for me, please? - Yeah. Let's get some of them starting to work. TYROL: We'll sleep when we're dead. Come on. Boomer. Heard the latest? They say Cylons look like us now. - Primary fuel? - Primary fuel 2893 KRG. Marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on Ragnar because they actually thought that he was a Cylon. You know what? I don't give a frak. Red light on the number four thruster. Go make a visual ID. See if it's blocked. - Right. - "Right." A little rough on your new ECO, don't you think? He's not my ECO. He's some refugee from Triton that I'm saddled with and I didn't ask you. - Helo's gone, Sharon. - I didn't ask you that, either. Sorry. - Colony? - Saggitaron. How many have you got? SOCINUS: We can't transmit photos yet. If you want, you can leave them with us or you can put them on the board outside. Sorry. DUALLA: Thanks. SOCINUS: Next. SOCINUS: Colony? [Sombre instrumental music.] [Sombre instrumental music intensifies.] [Sighing.] Update on the headcount, Madam President. How did we lose 300? There were some overcounts a few deaths from wounds and a few missing during the last attack. [Grave instrumental music.] Do you want children, Gaius? [lntense instrumental music.] Let me think about it for a minute. No. Procreation is one of God's commandments. Really? I'm sure some day if you're a good Cylon he'll reward you with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own. I want us to have a child, Gaius. BALTAR: You can't be serious. - It's Dr. Amarak. - What was that? I'm so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking. You were just saying? I was just saying that a Dr. Amarak - has requested to speak with the President. - Dr. Amarak. I see. You know him? Have you always been able to multitask like this? Yes. I used to work with him at the Ministry of Defence. It says here that he's uncovered important information regarding how the Cylons were able to defeat colonial defences. I was always a little worried he was on to us. Were you going to speak to him? BALTAR: Perhaps I should speak to him if you're busy. BILLY: I think he wanted to speak directly with the President. It sounded urgent. It must be very important. Maybe something about a certain traitor in the President's inner circle? There's not enough time before we jump. I want him on board first thing during the next cycle. Thank you, Doctor. - I'd say you have a serious problem. - lf I can help. He's a strange one, isn't he? [Eerie instrumental music.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Helo panting.] [Continues panting.] [Explosions.] [Robots grunting.] [Robots screeching.] [Suspenseful instrumental music continues.] [Screaming.] [Helo panting.] [Ticking.] MAN: [Over PA.] Landing base Team Alpha, check three. DUALLA: Can you see it? Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion. That makes 61. Have the docs start pumping them up with stimulants and get them back on the line. ADAMA: Pilots, too. DUALLA: Fuel report. One out of every three, every other cycle. TIGH: That's gonna come back and bite us on the ass. ADAMA: We have too much work and not enough people to do it. DUALLA: Fuel report. - I've already signed one of these. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Comm traffic two from the President. - Is this my 10 minutes or this yours? - Yours. I took 10 last time. See you guys in combat. I believe it was your 10 minutes. If the old man's so tired he can't remember, then it's his turn. - You see the note from the XO? - Yeah, I saw it. No way. APOLLO: Kara, everyone else STARBUCK: I don't fly with stims. They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time. - Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just - Why are we arguing about this? APOLLO: I have no idea. Neither do I. You're the CAG, act like one. What the hell does that mean? It means that you're still acting like you're everyone's best friend. We're not friends, you're the CAG. "Be careful out there"? Our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky. STARBUCK: "Good hunting" is what you say. And now, one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take her pills. So she either says, "Yes, sir" and obeys a direct order or you smack her in the mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay and you make her take those pills. [Kara laughs.] Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you. You're damn right you're glad. So, do I have to smack you in the mouth, Lieutenant? No, sir. I'll take my pills. Perfect. - Carry on. - Yes, sir. DISPATCHER: Pilots to ready room for pre-flight briefing. Pilots to ready room. What? [Rain pattering.] [Gasping.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Tense instrumental music.] [Panting.] [Gun cocking.] [Gasping.] Jump 238 complete. ADAMA: Start the clock. GAETA: [Over PA.] Thirty-three minutes. Mark. All civilian ships present and [Electronic beeping.] Strike my last. One civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir. TIGH: Which one? DUALLA: The Olympic Carrier. DUALLA: Commercial passenger vessel. ADAMA: Were they left behind? DUALLA: I think I accounted for all civilian ships before we left. You think? Did you or didn't you? [Electronic beeping.] They're not logged in, sir. I think they may have been left behind. How many people aboard ship? You're telling me we left over 1,300 people to die at the hands of the Cylons? It may not have been her fault, sir. It may have been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates or the Cylons destroyed the ship before the jump Or 50 other things may have happened. The point is we don't know what the hell did happen. Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief. Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us time after time and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs. We make mistakes, people die. There aren't many of us left. Carry on. [Melancholic instrumental music.] Okay. Next crisis? [Billy sighs dejectedly.] - List of calls? - Yes. But first, where's the doctor who's supposed to be on board? What's his name? - Dr. Amarak. - Yes. Dr. Amarak. Oh. He was on the Olympic Carrier. [Seagulls cawing.] NO. 6: God is watching out for you, Gaius. The universe is a vast and complex system. Coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur. Indeed they are to be expected. - It's part of the pattern, part of the plan. - Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you. Now he's gone. Logic says there's a connection. BALTAR: A connection, maybe. But not God. There is no God or gods, singular or plural. There are no large invisible men, or women for that matter in the sky taking a personal interest in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar. Be careful. That which God gives, he can also take away. [Sombre instrumental music.] [Tense instrumental music.] Fifteen seconds. [Electronic beeping.] Maybe this time. Dradis? No enemy contacts. Keep the clock running. What do you think? I think we wait. [Tense instrumental music continues.] [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] [Beeping.] [Sighs.] Get me the President. Why this time? Was it something that you did? We had a new plan, but we didn't have time to implement it yet. We lost a ship during the last cycle, the Olympic Carrier. Does that have something to do with it? ADAMA: Possibly. [Tense instrumental music continues.] Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. What do we do now, Commander? I've got people on the verge over here. We're gonna go to Condition Two. We have to take advantage of this time - and let our people get some rest. - All right. And how long do we stay at Condition Two? Until I'm satisfied they're not going to return. ADAMA: It's a military decision. It is. I know that. You're right and I defer to your decision. And, Commander let your men and women know how grateful I am for the job that they are doing, please. Thank them for me. ADAMA: Thank you, Madam President. ADAMA: Thank you. ADAMA: Contact Apollo. ADAMA: Tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet and order his other pilots to land immediately. All right, people, you heard the order. Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me. We'll fly the first CAP. APOLLO: I want everyone else back on Galactica and in their racks. APOLLO: Three-hour rotation. STARBUCK: Hey, Apollo not that I'm not honoured by being chosen to sit in my cockpit for the next three hours but APOLLO: But why you? - Take a guess. - Because I'm on drugs? [Chuckling.] You got it. This patrol is 100% stimulated. CRASHDOWN: Anyone else feels like they've got frakking ants crawling behind their eyeballs? APOLLO: How about you, Boomer? Doc tells me you're holding up better than anybody in the squadron. BOOMER: I'm tired like everybody else. APOLLO: You never seem it. STARBUCK: Because she's a Cylon. You're gonna make me come over there and kick your ass. Okay. Let's set up a patrol here before somebody gets hurt. APOLLO: Follow me. STARBUCK: Copy that, Apollo. A couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet TIGH: right about now. ADAMA: You deserve it. Thank you. The truth is all this has me feeling more alive than I have in years. You look that way, too. It's good to you without the cup in your hand. Don't start. I know there's a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you weren't feeling as good as you were. If the crew doesn't hate the XO, then he's not doing his job. Besides, got to make the old man look good. I always look good. - Did you look in a mirror? - Seriously GAETA: Sir. it's one thing to push a crew, it's another to break them. [Loud beeping.] Dradis contact. Bearing 348, carom 120, one ship. Getting recognition signal. MAN: Initiating response flash mode. Alpha, alpha. It's the Olympic Carrier, sir. ADAMA: Is that confirmed? DUALLA: It's confirmed, sir. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Thank the gods. [Suspenseful instrumental music continues.] Action stations. [Suspenseful instrumental music intensifies.] Put the fleet into Condition One. I want all Vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes. TIGH: Mr. Gaeta. GAETA: Sir? Restart the clock. Thirty-three minutes. [Electronic beeping.] - Hope you're wrong. - So do I. GAETA: Clock is running. ADAMA: So do I. [Beeping.] No. It's all wrong. If they were left behind, why didn't the Cylons destroy them? And why are they showing up now? It's God's punishment for your lack of faith. That's just great, that is. A more logical and useful explanation, please. All right. The Olympic Carrier has been infiltrated by Cylon agents. [Ominous instrumental music.] They've been tracking the ship all along. No. Then that means Logically, in order for you to survive the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed. BOOMER: Olympic Carrier this is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer. I have you in visual contact. Please respond to this channel. Over. MAN: Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier. We have you in visual contact. Thank the Lords of Kobol. You don't know how relieved we are to see you. BOOMER: Roger that, Olympic Carrier. Can I ask about your whereabouts? MAN: We had trouble with our FTL drive. Took us almost three hours to fix. ADAMA: Have Boomer ask them how they escaped the Cylons. BOOMER: Olympic Carrier, Boomer. I've been directed to ask how you escaped from the Cylons. MAN: They were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping. I thought we were goners, then they just broke off. Someone must've been watching out for us. BOOMER: Roger that. MAN: One other thing, Boomer. I've got a Dr. Amarak on board who has an urgent matter to discuss with the President. - He's been driving me crazy. - Can you be more specific? MAN: I can't. He says he knows something about a traitor in our midst and he's unwilling to share more than that. Madam President, I strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away. Why? Look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? The Olympic Carrier is still flying because the Cylons let them survive. They've been tracking that ship all along. - There's probably a Cylon agent aboard now! - Calm down. Start over. Please, Madam President, I implore you. Listen to me. Cut off radio communication with that ship before they send via broadcast signal another computer virus to affect our ship shortly before they blow us all up. Commander Adama, are you on the line? Cut off the speakers. Put her through on the line. ADAMA: Yes, Madam President. And I'm inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar. Good. So do I. Thank the gods you're with us. God's got nothing to do with this. [Tense instrumental music.] [Beeping.] DUALLA: Boomer, Galactica. Your orders are to jam all transmissions from the Olympic Carrier. No further voice contact is authorised. Roger that, Galactica. DUALLA: Boomer, Galactica. Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier the following message by signal light. Message begins: Maintain present position. DUALLA: Do not, repeat, do not approach the fleet until further notice. Message ends. I'm getting a bad feeling about where this is headed. So am I. If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] I don't think they got the message, Apollo. Yeah, I see it. Boomer, break wireless silence on my authority. Warn them to stop their engines immediately. I suggest that we evacuate the passengers, then destroy the ship. Solves the problem if they're tracking the ship. What if they're tracking one of the passengers? BOOMER: Olympic Carrier you are ordered to stop your engines immediately. Acknowledge. BOOMER: Apollo, they're not responding. APOLLO: Are you using the same channel? BOOMER: Yeah, but suddenly nobody's home. Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow. Copy that. [Ship's guns firing.] [Suspenseful instrumental music continues.] Boomer, let Galactica know we have a problem out here. Commander, message from Boomer. The Olympic Carrier is heading directly for us, sir. They're refusing all orders to stop. [Suspenseful instrumental music intensifies.] BOOMER: Galactica, they're still not responding and continue to head towards the fleet. Request instructions. Order the fleet to execute Jump 240. Get us between that ship and the fleet. GAETA: Commander! Dradis contact. Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts. [Rapid electronic beeping.] It's the Cylons. [Dramatic instrumental music.] CRASHDOWN: The Cylons are on an intercept course. They'll be in weapons range within two minutes. [Alarm beeping.] Radiological alarm! - Radiological alarm! - From where? [Alarm beeping.] The Olympic Carrier, sir. They've got nukes on board. Madam President, we have to eliminate the Olympic Carrier immediately. There are 1,300 people on that ship. ADAMA: We don't know that. The Cylons may have captured them already. She's not going to do it. She has to do it. - It's not her decision, Gaius. - No? NO. 6: It's God's choice. He wants you to repent. Look, at this point there's no choice. It's either them or us. Repent of your sins and accept his true love and you will be saved. [Tense instrumental music.] I repent. Then I'll repent. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] I repent. Do it. BOOMER: We have new orders. We're directed to destroy the Olympic Carrier and return to Galactica. It's a civilian ship. APOLLO: Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes. [Sombre instrumental music.] APOLLO: I don't see anybody in there, do you? The Cylons will be here any second. If we're going to do this, then just do it. Starbuck, form up with me. APOLLO: We'll make one pass from astern. STARBUCK: Lee, what if you're wrong? [Sombre instrumental music continues.] STARBUCK: Lee, come on. Okay, fire on my mark. No frakking way, Lee. Lee? Come on! [Tense instrumental music.] Mark. [Ship's guns firing.] [Rain pattering.] [Helo grunting defiantly.] Are you alive? [Panting.] Agathon, Karl C. Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial fleet. - PK-789-9348. - I know who you are, Helo. It's all right. I'm a friend. [Gunshot.] [No. 6 gasps.] [Solemn instrumental music.] [Both gasping.] Sharon? HELO: What are you doing here? BOOMER: Can you walk? [Helo grunting.] Yeah, I think so. - What are you doing here, I thought - Let's move, mister. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] APOLLO: Sir. ADAMA: Son. [Adama sighs.] I gave the order. It's my responsibility. I pulled the trigger. That's mine. [Sombre instrumental music.] BILLY: Madam President? BILLY: Madam President? I'm sorry, you were saying something? Twenty-four hours, no Cylons. - At least you know it was the right choice. - The right choice. I'm sorry, Billy. I think I'd like some time alone, please. BILLY: Of course. [Sombre instrumental music continues.] What is it? - Update on the headcount? - Subtract how many? Actually, you can add one. A baby was born this morning on the Rising Star. A boy. - A baby. - Yeah. Thank you. [Serene instrumental music.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica: [Dramatic instrumental music.] Sharon, get out of here! Where are you? Sharon! TYROL: Halt! No sudden moves. Get on your knees and cross your ankles. Now! I'm human. I'm from Oasis. It's a hamlet, public stop. I'm out of Havoca City. I'm not a Cylon! Don't leave me! SPEAKER: Attention, the Scorpia Traveller has docked. Any civilians currently boarding Galactica please proceed to security checkpoint. [Sinister instrumental music.] Thank you. SPEAKER: Flight Maintenance Crew Bravo report to Flight 3. CORPORAL: Next. Next. MAN: Yes, okay. TYROL: It's all clear? CALLY: I've got your back, Chief. Thanks. [Door closing.] [Both moaning.] [Boomer chuckling.] - Anybody see you? - No. I went through the hatch combing on C Causeway. Good girl. SPEAKER: Bravo team, EOD, stand by for munitions off-loading. Hangar Bay 2. [lntense instrumental music.] You know, sometimes at work I try to conjure up what your face looks like. The curve of your lips the way your hair falls, how you smell. You see my face every day. Yeah, but not like this. [Mysterious instrumental music.] [Mysterious instrumental music intensifies.] Security, XO. Send an armed detail to meet me in the midpoint promenade deck causeway, C level. Approach from the aft. Repeat. Approach from the aft. Doral! [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Dramatic instrumental music intensifies.] [Exclaiming.] [Theme music.] [Exclaiming in pain.] What's the count? - Three dead. 13 injured. - Did you get a good look at the bomber? - Yes. - It was him, right? Yes. I want to see the Master at Arms in my office in ten minutes. A Cylon? HADRIAN: Eyewitness accounts state the bomber was a man. The Cylons look like us now. Like us? Yes, they appear human. The flesh, the blood the whole thing. The bomber was another copy of a man we knew as Doral posing as the Public Relations Officer aboard this ship. They've learned that there are multiple versions of the same Cylon. I want you to open an investigation immediately. I want to find out how that Cylon or any civilian - could break through our security. - There's been a string of security incidents aboard ship, sir. The water tank explosion, the discovery of explosives aboard a Raptor - and now this. - Your point? [lntense instrumental music.] I need a free hand. The authority to follow evidence wherever it might lead without command review. - Independent tribunal? - Yes, sir. You'll get it. HADRIAN: Thank you. ADAMA: That will be all, Sergeant. I also strongly recommend alerting the public to the Cylon threat. If there are other copies of this man aboard the fleet we should find them before they strike again. I'll take that under advisement. ADAMA: That will be all. HADRIAN: Yes, sir. Open to the public. There's a can of worms. Keeping silent hasn't helped us very much. Maybe shining a light on the situation will make things pop up. ADAMA: All right. ADAMA: Hey. I owe you one. - Sir. - Colonel. Get me the President. CALLY: Don't kink the line. JAMMER: There, we've got it. SOCINUS: Okay, let's go. So who's first? How about me? - Hey, Chief. - How's it going there, on top? - Hi. - Come on. Let's have it. Come on. TYROL: You people are the sorriest of the sorry. TYROL: The dumbest of the dumb. TYROL: The only thing you're making out of this is a one-way trip to sick bay or the morgue. Now, tonight, after night call one of you brings me twice this length of copper tubing a spot heater and a CO2 scrubber. I'll show you people how this is done. TYROL: All right? Now get the hell out of here before I change my mind. TYROL: Thank you. Children. NO. 6: He's very handsome. DORAL: You really think so? BOOMER: She says that about everyone. NO. 6: You disagree? He's attractive. NO. 6: I hope you're more convincing than that with him. If he wants to find me, he'll head north, toward Cylon forces he's already seen. If he wants to go alone, he'll go south, hoping to find another way off the planet. Either way, he won't make his move until nightfall. DORAL: If he flees, he dies. ROSLIN: There's going to be a huge reaction. If there are any other Cylons aboard any of our ships, we need to find them. If we enlist the help of the public, it'll make it a lot easier. People are going to be shocked, angry, terrified, paranoid. There is a price to be paid when asking for the public's help. They're going to demand, at the very least, that someone be held accountable. I'm setting up a tribunal. That tribunal will have to come back to the public with a name. Someone who screwed up. We don't know if anybody screwed up. A Cylon agent penetrated your security, killing three people. At least one of your men or women screwed up. Look, here's my view: Independent tribunal, openness, transparency, it all sounds great. But after 20 years in political office, I'm telling you these things have a way of inflicting damage on the people you least expect. I do not want a witch hunt on our hands. HADRIAN: So, where were you at the time of the bombing? In my rack, reading some trashy novel Socinus gave me. - Did you see the Chief? - Chief? He was on the Hangar Deck going over some paperwork, I think. HADRIAN: How do you know that if you were in your rack? [Tense instrumental music.] I saw him right before I turned in. I was with Cally playing Pyramid in the mess hall corridor. HADRIAN: You sure? JAMMER: Yeah. She's pretty good. - Did you see the Chief? - Yeah, he was there. I mean, not the whole time. He dropped in, watched us play for a while. Okay. SOCINUS: I was on watch. HADRIAN: Did you see the Chief? The Chief? No. - He wasn't on the Hangar Deck? - No. Wait. Yeah. Yeah, he was. He came in, did some work on one of the Vipers that the Captain rides. Thank you. - Asleep in my rack. - Sure about that? Positive. I was asleep, Sergeant. All right. That'll be all for now. Good afternoon and thank you for coming. Please be seated. I'm sure by now, word of the explosion on the Galactica has spread to the entire fleet. We offer our continued gratitude to the brave men and women aboard this mighty ship. In consultation with Commander Adama I have appointed an independent tribunal to investigate the circumstances surrounding this explosion. Also, in the interest of security and public safety I feel it is time to reveal certain information that has until now remained a tightly-guarded secret. This information was known only to myself, Commander Adama - and a few select advisors. - The cat's out of the bag. The Cylons have the ability to mimic human form. They look like us now. [Crowd mutters in disbelie.] ROSLIN: We have reason to believe that a Cylon agent was responsible for the explosions aboard Galactica. This man has been identified as a Cylon agent. We believe him to be responsible for the bombing. He evidently slipped aboard the Galactica with a civilian group killed a Marine guard, stole the explosives and detonated them killing three members of the crew and destroying himself. ROSLIN: This man has also been identified as a Cylon. And we now know that there are duplicates of each Cylon model. Anyone seeing either of these two men at anytime, anywhere in the fleet should immediately contact the Battlestar Galactica and the office of the President. Now I'll take your questions. [Reporters exclaiming together.] They've known about this the whole time and they tell us now? Cylon? - I mean, who's the Cylon now? - This is too much. I don't even want to know this. Excuse me, sir. Will you come with us, please? BOOMER: What? Why? TYROL: What's going on, Sergeant? HADRIAN: Chief, we need you to come along as well. You're arresting the Chief? SOCINUS: Who's arresting him? - No one is under arrest. - What's all this? HADRIAN: Step back. Lieutenant asked you a question, Sergeant. A Tribunal has been convened to look into the Cylon penetration of our defences. It requires the presence of Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol. I am here to escort them to the Wardroom. Sir. [Tense instrumental music.] Very well. CRASHDOWN: Proceed. HADRIAN: Thank you, sir. Lieutenant, Chief, you'll come with me, please. You're it till I get back. Don't worry. HADRIAN: Lt. Valerii, where were you at the time of the explosion? I was in my rack. Asleep. HADRIAN: Did anyone see you, sir? BOOMER: I don't know. I was asleep. HADRIAN: Lieutenant is it true that you and the Chief are involved in a romantic and physical relationship in violation of the Colonial Code of Military Conduct? - I thought this was about - Just answer the question, please. Are you and the Chief involved in a relationship? No. The XO ordered us to put a stop to it. And so we did. [Serious instrumental music.] HADRIAN: Sir, can you testify as to the whereabouts of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol at the time of the bombing? I have no idea where he was. - Thank you, sir. - You're excused, Lieutenant. But I am sure he had nothing to do with the bombing You are excused, Lieutenant. HADRIAN: Bring in the next witness, please. HADRIAN: The testimony you give before this tribunal may be used to adjudicate your guilt or innocence in the matter under investigation. Do you understand? Yes. HADRIAN: The matter being investigated is first how a Cylon, penetrated Galactica's security system and second, whether one of Galactica's crew members aided and abetted this crime through conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons. Collusion with the Cylons? HADRIAN: Do you consent to give your testimony freely without invoking your right to remain silent as provided for under the 23rd Article of Colonization? - I do. - Then let's begin. [Grave instrumental music.] CALLY: They're going after the Chief. JAMMER: They're going after the Cylons. - What the hell does that mean? - Wake up. The world's changed while you were asleep. SOCINUS: Frak you. Cylons look like people. That means anyone. Anyone. - Not the Chief. - How do you know? - I know. - This is stupid. You two just don't want to deal with reality. JAMMER: You want to keep your heads buried in the sand. That's exactly what the Cylons want. For us to turn on each other. CALLY: Start getting suspicious, paranoid. SOCINUS: She's right. If we don't believe in each other when the heat comes down, we're nothing. That kind of thinking is over. It's every man for himself now. You better watch your backs. HADRIAN: You had the mid-watch before the bombing, correct? Yes. Would you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch? TYROL: I walk the perimeter of the Hangar Deck the tool rooms, storage facilities. To make sure all hatches are sealed? TYROL: Yes. That no unauthorised personnel is poking around where they shouldn't? That's right. And there was no one on the Hangar Deck that night. HADRIAN: I believe that's what your log says. What about the hatch combing for Causeway C? - Anybody see you? - No. I went through the hatch combing on C Causeway. HADRIAN: Your log indicates that all hatches and portals were locked and sealed. If that's what the log indicates, then that's the case. Which would include the hatch combing for Causeway C? I don't know where the Sergeant is going with this. TYROL: But they're not related. HADRIAN: What if I told you that I found the hatch open after the bombing? I would say that I don't know how that's possible. It's not just any hatch on the Hangar Deck. It opens onto a causeway which leads directly to a small arms locker where a Marine guard was found dead at the scene. The locker was opened with the correct code. Do you have the correct code to that locker, Chief? Yes, I do, as do dozens of others, including the guard. It's possible the Cylon forced the guard to open it before he killed him. I want to take this opportunity to state that, that was an internal security matter. And this falls under the purview of the Master at Arms. And the Master at Arms is Sergeant Hadrian. Did Lt. Valerii leave the hatch combing open last night? I have no idea who left the hatch combing open last night. Chief, were you doing paperwork at the time of the bombing? - No. - Were you working on a Viper at that time? No. Were you watching a pick-up game of Pyramid in the mess hall at the time of the bombing? No! As I told you earlier today, I was asleep in my rack. HADRIAN: Then why do I have three different statements from three of your deckhands stating variously that they all saw you and you were anywhere but in your rack? Chief Tyrol, where were you at the time of the bombing? [Tense instrumental music.] HADRIAN: Were you, in fact, meeting with a Cylon agent? I exercise my right under Article 23. By invoking the 23rd Article at this time, the tribunal will look on this as further evidence of your guilt. So I will ask you one last time. Who were you with at the time of the bombing and was this person a Cylon agent? HADRIAN: Your sworn statement indicates that you were on watch at the time of the bombing and that you saw Chief Tyrol - work on one of the Vipers. Is that true? - Yes, sir. Specialist, can you explain to us why Chief Tyrol told us in his testimony that he was in his rack asleep at the time of the bombing? [Stuttering.] HADRIAN: Speak up, Specialist. SOCINUS: He said that? Did you see him or didn't you? HADRIAN: Specialist! SOCINUS: No, I did not, sir. So the Chief did not come to the Hangar Deck after all? I don't know. I left my post. Excuse me? I left my post, sir. I ducked out to get a smoke. I went to the galley to get some chow. The Chief I mean, I don't know where he was. I'm sure he was asleep in his rack just like he said. You went to the galley? Yes, sir. Did you go through the hatch combing on C Deck? Well, to get to the galley, that would be the best way. Yes, sir, I went through that hatch. - Did you leave it open? - I'm not sure. Yes, sir. I think I did. The Chief had nothing to do with it. It was me. I left my post and I left the hatch open. It was me. Just me. You realise, that by leaving the hatch open, you allowed a Cylon to gain access to the small arms locker? Yes, sir. Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon to gain access to the small arms locker? The Chief is innocent. He didn't do anything. Specialist, did you leave the hatch open deliberately? Yes, sir. Whatever happened, it was me. Just me. [Soft instrumental music.] South. You overestimated his willingness to risk himself for you. He just doesn't love you. Wait. North. Toward his love. Seems you made an impression after all. He's a good man. He always does the right thing. Are you prepared for the next step? Yes. - Hello, Lieutenant. - Doctor. I brought you a cigar. A recovery gift. - How are you? - I'm good. The food is good, company is better. Yes, I just happened to be absolutely nowhere near sick bay. BALTAR: I thought I would - see how you were doing. - So, Doctor your super secret project's on C Deck, right? I'm not at liberty to divulge exactly what I am doing on C Deck. But you're more than welcome to pop by. Once you're ambulatory. - The bomber was on C Deck, right? - Yes, I know. I heard the explosion. - Very frightening. - Do you think that's where he was headed? [Tense instrumental music.] - I'm sorry. I didn't follow you. - The Cylon bomber? Do you think that he was trying to blow up your project? NO. 6: And you along with it? It's funny. I hadn't thought of that. Kind of hits you where you live, huh? Yes, it does, actually. You get well soon. BALTAR: They're trying to kill me. Me, always me. They're trying to destroy your work. NO. 6: Destroying you is an added bonus. BALTAR: But why? BALTAR: I don't understand. Why are they trying to blow me up? BALTAR: You told me what to do. BALTAR: I wouldn't be making this Cylon detector if it wasn't for you. NO. 6: But I'm just in your head, Gaius. They don't know about me or us or our life together. How romantic. I'm going to have to destroy that Cylon detector myself. Blame the sabotage on Cylon agents. That's what I'll tell Adama. [Dramatic instrumental music.] No, you won't. You're gonna complete the project just like I told you. Really? Would I? Or what? Don't make me angry, Gaius. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. DORAL: Sharon. NO. 6: Is that enough? [Slow instrumental music.] No, Sharon wouldn't give up without a much earned fight. [Boomer grunting.] [Fast-paced instrumental music.] ADAMA: Did you read the tribunal report? ROSLIN: Yes. And I'm sorry to read that one of your men has been charged with conspiracy - and collusion with a Cylon agent. - Specialist Socinus. But after reading the transcripts I have my doubts. What about this other man, your Chief Tyrol, he took the 23rd? - What is that about, do you think? - It's his right. The courts have never held that invoking the right to remain silent can be used as evidence of guilt. You sound like a lawyer. My father was a lawyer. Civil liberties. Let's set aside the legalities for a moment. Obviously, you are defending your man. I respect that, I do. But he is hiding something. Chief Tyrol has been under my command for over five years. And if he had really wanted to take this ship down he could. This is over. [Door opening.] [lntense instrumental music.] Madam President, I'm gonna have to call you right back. What? I have orders to bring you before the tribunal, sir. Let's go. [Soothing instrumental music.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Footsteps echoing.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Grunting.] HELO: It's okay. BOOMER: Helo. What's happening? HELO: Can you walk? BOOMER: I think so. HELO: Come on. I got you. Okay. Now we're even. - I think we should go. - Right. Okay. HELO: Come on. It's going to be all right. You're going to be just fine. [Helo panting.] HADRIAN: Commander Adama, when did you first learn the truth about the Cylons? On Ragnar station. Before we left. And you chose to withhold this crucial information, sir? ADAMA: Yes. HADRIAN: Why? I felt that to alarm the public, would only cause chaos and panic. But you also withheld the information from your own security detachment aboard ship, sir. Not knowing who to trust, I decided to keep the information compartmentalised for the time being. Sir, isn't it true that had we known that the Cylons appeared human different security procedures would have been followed? Probably. But I had to weigh the possible ramifications of both. HADRIAN: Isn't it also true, sir, that had different procedures been followed - the bombing may have been prevented? - That's speculative. - I'm asking if it's possible. - I know what you're asking, Sergeant. I will not speculate as to what might have happened. Do you personally believe that a Cylon agent planted explosives in the ship's water tank? Yes. Do you believe that there are Cylon agents aboard ship even as we speak? Yes, I do. HADRIAN: Sir, isn't it true that you knew that Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol were having an illicit relationship in violation of regulations? I don't see the relevance of this line of questioning, Sergeant. The commander should bear in mind that my questions are not subject to the Commander's review. Why did you allow the relationship to continue knowing it was against regulations? I'm a soft touch. Sir, are you aware that both Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol have been implicated as possibly being in collusion with the Cylons? I'm aware of the allegations. Where are you going with this? I will ask the questions, sir. Isn't it true that by allowing their relationship to continue in violation of regulations you may have made it possible for two Cylon collaborators to compromise the safety and security of this ship? [Exhaling.] We're done here. Excuse me, sir, but my questions are not finished. You've lost your way, Sergeant. You've lost sight of the purpose of the law to protect its citizens, not persecute them. Whatever we are, whatever is left of us. We're better than that. ADAMA: Now these proceedings are closed. You'll be transported back to your ships, and we appreciate your help. MYSON: Commander. This is an independent board. You have no authority to close our inquiry. This is a witch hunt. I will not have it aboard my ship. Corporal of the guard! Restrain the Commander and return him back to the witness chair. Your orders are to escort Sergeant Hadrian back to her quarters and keep her in confinement until further notice. Make your choice, son. Sergeant Hadrian, you'll come with us, please. MAN: She's just about to speak. WOMAN: Yes, I tried to get an interview with her myself. Good evening, have a seat. The investigation into the suicide bombing aboard Galactica and how it was allowed to occur has come to a close. You are all aware that the bomber was a Cylon agent. The tribunal has determined that the Cylon gained access to the explosives by going through a hatch door in the Hangar Deck of the ship. This door was left open due to negligence of one of the ship's crewmen. His name is Specialist Socinus. He has confessed to lying under oath and dereliction of duty in a time of war. He has been stripped of his rank and confined to the Brig. At this point, we have no reason to believe that there were any other parties responsible. Now I'll take your questions. You, sir. TYROL: Commander, permission to enter? ADAMA: What is it, Chief? TYROL: Thank you, sir. Sir, I believe that Socinus I believe that his confession was a lie. I think that he's covering for me. For you? I think that he's doing this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me. Somewhere in this there's truth. Care to take me to it? Sir, I was with Lt. Valerii at the time of the bombing. The Deck gang, they all knew it. They've known all along. TYROL: They're trying to cover for me. They started lying. Socinus I think that he thinks he's helping protect me by taking a fall like this. You don't really know if he was on duty or not, do you? Commander, he's innocent. I know that much. I should be in the Brig. Well, that's a fact. You should be in the Brig. Commander, this isn't right. - You can't let an innocent kid - I can't? [lntense instrumental music.] What I can't do is I can't let someone that wears this uniform get on the witness stand and lie under oath. And that's what your man did. He either lied the first time or he lied the second time. And it doesn't matter. He's guilty and he'll pay the price. ADAMA: You? You'll pay a different price. You'll have to walk out on that Hangar Deck every day knowing that one of your men is in the Brig because you couldn't keep your fly zipped. You're the most experienced, noncommissioned officer we have left. You keep my planes flying. I need my planes to fly. Dismissed. Sir. TYROL: Sharon, no. BOOMER: What? Sharon, we're done. It's over. - What do you mean it's over? - I love you. I really do. I'm sorry. Wait a minute. BOOMER: I deserve more of an explanation than that. [Sombre instrumental music.] Sure. One of my men is in the Brig. He confessed to a crime he didn't commit to protect me, to protect us. There can be no more "us." No more secrets, no more lies, that's it. It's over. I can't believe you can just turn your back on us. I put everything on the line for you. Everything. I cover for you, I protect you. TYROL: I risk my career, my freedom, my integrity, for what? [Screaming.] So some innocent kid, one of my kids, can take the fall for me? TYROL: No! We are not worth that. Okay. Right. I guess I'll see you around. One more thing. Did you leave the hatch combing open last night? What? Did you leave the hatch combing open last night? What are you saying? BOOMER: That I helped the Cylon? TYROL: I didn't say anything. I'm just asking a question. I think I deserve an answer. You have the only answer you're ever gonna get. [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica: [Dramatic instrumental music.] NO. 6: Ignoring me won't help. BALTAR: No, I've decided you're an expression of my subconscious mind playing itself out in my waking states. So, I'm in your head? Of course if you're not really here, neither am I. Do you have any idea what they would do to me if they find out? They'd probably charge you with treason. Treason is punishable by the death penalty. HELO: Come on, Sharon. Where are you? [Dramatic instrumental music.] Helo! BOOMER: We gotta go. Right now. BALTAR: I don't see the hand of God in here. Could I be looking in the wrong place? BALTAR: Let me see. Proteins? Yes. Haemoglobin? Yes. BALTAR: Divine digits? No. Sorry. I'm sure I can find evidence of his divine hand in one of these delightful samples. After all, there are so fracking many I'm sure even I can be relied upon to find God in one of them. What is it that drives you to blasphemy, Gaius? NO. 6: A need to tempt fate? BALTAR: Boredom, actually. BALTAR: Indeed, every waking hour is spent in what some might say, has become my own personal religion. The Church of the Mystic Cylon Detector. Are you finished? [Mysterious instrumental music.] NO. 6: If you would give yourself over to God's will you'd find peace in his love as I have. Could you help me with this zipper? I'm having trouble. NO. 6: He has a plan for us. BALTAR: How do you know it's a he? There is only one, true God. Really? You running a glitch in the programme or something? 'Cause you say the same thing over and over again. Now, I've accepted your God and all that. Can't we reboot the hard drive? He's not my God. He is God. Yeah, your God, my God, everyone's God. He's big enough for all of us, isn't he? Now, please. BALTAR: Please, honey. Can't we do something a little more elevating? It's important you form a personal relationship with God. Only you can give yourself over to his eternal love. For God's sake! BALTAR: I can't take this anymore! NO. 6: I'm trying to save your immortal soul. What you are doing, darling, is boring me to death with your superstitious drivel. Your metaphysical nonsense which, to be fair, actually appeals to the half-educated dullards that make up most of human society, but which, I hasten to add no rational, intelligent, free-thinking human being truly believes. Which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Cylons are, in the final [Mysterious instrumental music continues.] That Cylons are, in the final analysis, little more than toasters with great looking legs. It's my fantasy. See if I care. I'll dream up someone new a brunette maybe. [Knocking on door.] Maybe we can dispense with the foreplay. Get right down to What did you say? That was nothing. I was just talking to myself. I talk to myself. Hang me. The Commander would like to see you in the CIC, Doctor. There you are. Very nice. - That blouse could open up a button. - Excuse me? You wanted to see me, Commander? ADAMA: Miss Godfrey has brought some very disturbing accusations to my attention. I think you should have the chance to answer them in person. Right. Thank you. - And she is? - She's standing right there. - I'm right here. - Yeah, of course you are. - And? - Doctor, this is Miss Godfrey. [Baltar clears throat.] All of you can see her? You can all see her! She's standing right next to you. - Something wrong? - No. Don't make me angry, Gaius. I'd say you have a serious problem. NO. 6: Get down. Yes, maybe I You'll have to forgive me, Miss Godfrey. I'm very pleased, if slightly puzzled, to make your acquaintance. Don't touch me, you traitor. Is she talking to me? You talking to me? You're the one who let the Cylons into the defence mainframe. You betrayed your entire race. You're the man responsible for the Holocaust and I'm here to see that you're exposed and sentenced to death as the traitor you really are. [Theme music.] Doctor, Miss Godfrey has made some startling accusations. I've never seen this woman before in my life. Not surprised you don't remember me. I was just a lowly systems analyst at the defence ministry. Doctor Amarak was my associate. She says you sold out the human race. You let the Cylons into our defence plans. NO. 6: Doctor Amarak told me he had evidence that Doctor Baltar was involved in the sneak attack. He was trying to reach the President and inform her when he was killed. - He told you that, did he? - Yes. It's a pity he's no longer with us. How convenient that we only have your word for that. - There's also this. - Yeah, what the frack's that? NO. 6: He gave me this for safekeeping. ADAMA: It's ID coded. Colonial Defence Ministry. Dr. Amarak gave the disk to me before he died. BALTAR: What, as opposed to after he died? NO. 6: He gave me the disk for safekeeping. On the disk is a photo. It was captured from the security camera in the defence mainframe on Caprica. NO. 6: It shows the doctor entering the mainframe without permission the day before the attack. [lntense instrumental music.] BALTAR: Nothing criminal about that. As you can see, the man in the photo is carrying an explosive device. BALTAR: Sorry, what? I definitely never did that. Just before the Cylon attack, the entire defence mainframe was destroyed by this device. BALTAR: Honestly, that is not me. I wasn't there. It's somebody else. BALTAR: Look, it's not me. I'm not the man in the photograph. ADAMA: I see a man. Same height, same build, but that's a long way from proof. Thank you, Commander. Now, if we're quite done with this charade, I'm I agree, Commander, but look here. In the faceplate of the computer terminal, there's a reflection of the man's face. TIGH: You can't tell anything from that. BALTAR: Thank you, Colonel. With the right equipment, the image could be enlarged and sharpened. We could see his face. Enlarging the image is no problem, but sharpening it - Take forever. - It'd take at least a day, sir. Mr. Gaeta, let me know as soon as you have an image. Sir. You're going to suspend all work on the Cylon detector - What? as well as your security privileges. CALLY: Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider are a mess. CALLY: She said "the engine power-up sequence began by squeezing something "that looks like a red ligament with blue veins on the right side "coming out of a sack of gooey fluid - "shaped like a dog." - Are you kidding me? This whole thing is a bunch of veins and ligaments and sacks of goo. CALLY: "Squeeze the ligament with your hand "while you slide your weight "on your left hip into the lymphatic sack." TYROL: That's just stupid. CALLY: Afternoon, sir. TIGH: Specialist. - Chief's inside? - Yeah. TIGH: Chief. TYROL: God! Yes, sir? TIGH: How's it coming in there? TYROL: I'm getting there, sir. I haven't quite figured out all the tricks, but I'm getting there. APOLLO: Come on, Starbuck, you can do it. That smarts. That smarts, but I don't care. You don't care. I don't care, because your pain is my entertainment. Your crutches of death, sir. Use them wisely. Shut up. It's gonna hurt like hell, but it's supposed to. Thanks, Doc. No pain, no gain. No cliché left unturned as Kara Thrace returns to the world of the walking. Can she do it or will she fall on her ass? I swear to the Gods, I'm gonna beat the crap out of both of you as soon as I get better. STARBUCK: No, I can't. APOLLO: Yes, you can. You did it. STARBUCK: I can't. You're not gonna get better lying on your back. Frack off! Just take a break for five minutes, we'll try again. I don't want to do it again. I want a pill, now, please. Sorry, we're weaning you off the magic pills starting today. Besides, I need them for myself. You son of a bitch. ROSLIN: I am finding this whole thing hard to fathom, Doctor. Thank you, Madam President. I can't tell you how much that means to me. Look, I was wondering, is there any chance that while this investigation is going on, I could come back to the Colonial One because I've left some of my things there. No, I'm sorry, Doctor. You have been put on a "no fly list." Security. BALTAR: [Whispering.] Madam President, I need to get off Galactica. I need to get away from this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular. She's got it in for me. BALTAR: Where are you? [Pounding instrumental music.] Madam President, I have reason to believe that she may be a Cylon. [lntense instrumental music.] Madam President? Madam President? BALTAR: Hello? BILLY: Get Doc Cottle on the wireless, the President has collapsed. Hello? EICK: Is she alive? BILLY: Yes, the President is alive. BILLY: I told you, she's conscious, she's resting. BILLY: She's receiving treatment. PLAYA: What kind of treatment? Asked and answered. BILLY: We think it's a stomach flu. PLAYA: What kind of treatment? How many of these did you take, young lady? - One, two? - Two. - Three. - Three times the dosage. Must work three times as fast then, right? Everybody wants to be their own doctor, you are lucky you didn't lapse into a coma. You can't cure cancer by overdose. [Knocking on door.] BILLY: Story's all over the fleet. I'm so sorry. ROSLIN: It's okay. It seemed like an emergency. I didn't think that anyone might be picking up the transmission. We're all new at this. It's okay. The thing to do now is to get me on my feet and in front of the press before the end of the day. I could give you a shot, but you wouldn't like the side effects. Just do it. The time is going to come when you won't be able to hide what you're going through. It's not that kind of a shot. Thank you. Baltar's correct about the convenience of it all. Amarak just happens to bring you the key piece of evidence just before he dies. Something was going on. He was almost paranoid. Kept saying that the Olympic Carrier had been infiltrated by the Cylons. He wanted me to take some things off the ship for safekeeping. Why'd he give it to you? We were friends. Friends? I loved him. I loved him very much. [Solemn instrumental music.] [No. 6 crying.] NO. 6: There are times when I just feel so alone now. Times when I just want so much to be held again. - You understand that, don't you? - Of course. There must be times when you feel alone. And the thought of another body next to yours seems like something out of dream. [Solemn instrumental music intensifies.] ADAMA: Do not, under any circumstances, allow Shelly Godfrey to leave this ship. Put her under surveillance, discreetly. I want to know everybody she's talked to, and everywhere she's been. [Dramatic instrumental music.] HELO: Come on, Sharon! Get up. [Dramatic instrumental music continues.] [Computer beeping.] PILOT: Excuse me. BALTAR: [Whispering.] Lieutenant? Is that you? GAETA: Doctor? BALTAR: Isn't this a coincidence. BALTAR: So, how are you doing? GAETA: I'm BALTAR: You're busy. Yes, I know. BALTAR: I don't mean to distract you. Please, don't let me interrupt you. [Baltar whistling.] BALTAR: You still there? GAETA: Yup. BALTAR: I know this is an awkward time. But it occurred to me I haven't told you how invaluable your assistance has been over the past few weeks. Thank you, Doctor. You have no idea how much that means to me. BALTAR: Not at all. BALTAR: So, how's it going over there? BALTAR: In the lab, that is? I'm talking about the photograph. GAETA: Right. It's coming along. BALTAR: Great. GAETA: Quickly, actually. A few more hours to go. BALTAR: Has it ever occurred to you that the photograph disk itself could be a fake? I've already authenticated the disk. BALTAR: Obviously, you're good. But there are many ways around security. If I could join you in the lab for just two minutes of your time, I could show you. I really don't think that's possible. Listen to me, nobody would need to know. It would just be you and me. GAETA: I know. For God's sake, my life is on the line. My reputation is at stake. GAETA: So is mine, Doctor. I really BALTAR: [Shushing.] Someone's coming. [Door closing.] [Toilet flushing.] BALTAR: Wait, Gaeta! You forgot to wash your hands! NO. 6: What the hell BALTAR: I want answers, now! BALTAR: I'm not interested in playing any more of your games! NO. 6: Have you lost your mind? BALTAR: That's an interesting question one I pose to myself on a regular basis. BALTAR: Who's really in the photograph? NO. 6: You are! I didn't plant any bomb, anywhere, at any time, and you know that. I don't know anything of this sort. Now, if you'll excuse me. All right. Let's entertain the notion, just for a moment that you are not the woman that I see everywhere. You are not Shelly Godfrey, either. You're a fake. You're just a copy. Another Cylon copy. Get out. BALTAR: Struck a nerve, have I? Which I find rather impossible to believe! You think this is over? This is not over! You have not heard the last. No more "Mr. Nice Gaius"! Women. [Machine whirring.] TYROL: Stupid. Unbelievable. TYROL: Bucket! BOOMER: Not a good time? No, it's fine. Guess you're having problems? TYROL: I can't get this thing to work. I've been over it and over it, and nothing. I have no idea how Starbuck got this thing to move. TYROL: Much less fly. BOOMER: It's not really a thing, you know. It's probably a Cylon itself. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] BOOMER: More of an animal maybe, than the human models. BOOMER: Maybe they genetically design it to perform a task. BOOMER: To be a fighter. Can't treat it like a thing and expect it to respond. You have to treat it like a pet. But, at least, that's my guess. - Your guess? - Yeah, that's right. My guess. BOOMER: Something else you want to say? TYROL: No. Lieutenant. I heard you were supposed to be up on your feet by now. STARBUCK: You heard wrong. I figured you wouldn't bounce back so fast. Is there something you wanted, or did you just drop by to torment me, sir? The Chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed so you could help figure out that Raider of yours. But, clearly, you still need the rest. Take your time. No rush. Do you actually think that reverse psychology crap is going to work on me? I really don't care what you think. All I know is that every day you spend in that bed is another day that I have my opinion of you confirmed. As you were. And I am convinced, in fact, that she is a Cylon agent. In my opinion, she should be locked up before she can do any more damage. [Tense instrumental music.] Where are you? BALTAR: You're having a little fun? Do you enjoy messing around with my life? ADAMA: Do you have any evidence to support this charge? Work on the Cylon detector is nearly complete with a few tweaks. I'll have a test regime up and running. All I need is a tissue sample from this woman for analysis. I thought we had something. Something special. ADAMA: I can't allow you access to your equipment. All right. But under instruction, I can surely tell Gaeta how to prepare the samples. - It's not difficult. - Let me be frank with you, Doctor. If your picture is on that photograph every piece of equipment in your laboratory will be dismantled and quarantined. And every person that you have met will be questioned and investigated. BALTAR: I love you. There, I've said it. Isn't that what you've been dying to hear? I am willing to make that commitment to you right now. The President believes I'm innocent. The President hopes you're innocent. And so do I. Because if you're not, then you've made fools of both of us. And I don't like to be made a fool of. And I don't like to be accused of participating in the genocide of the human race based solely on the word of a woman whom I have already indicated to you may well be a Cylon agent. I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all. I need your help. I did not conspire with the Cylons. I am an innocent man who is being convicted in the court of public opinion without trial. [Tense instrumental music.] [lncoherent voices.] WOMAN: Traitor. [Exhaling.] [Tense instrumental music.] WOMAN: Fire. All units report to damage control stations. MAN 1: We got a fire! MAN 2: Let's go. Clear the doors! [Alarm beeping.] [lndistinct chattering.] [Alarm beeping loudly.] Frack! No fires reported anywhere on the ship. TIGH: The exact location of the alarm. WOMAN: D-Wing corridor where it intersects with C-Wing. ADAMA: That's the lab. Erase. [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Dramatic instrumental music continues.] [Gasping.] TIGH: Put it down! Put it down. [Solemn instrumental music.] MAN 1: All right, move in. ADAMA: Take him to the Brig. MAN 1: Yes, Commander. I would like to speak to my attorney. Can't I speak to my attorney? BALTAR: I need some representation, it's not what it looks like. She's got it in for me, that Shelly Godfrey! STARBUCK: Shut up. All of you. Not one single word from any of you, okay? What seems to be the problem? Your new boyfriend's a bit of a jerk, sir. STARBUCK: It's a girl. TYROL: If you don't mind her goo on your face, she's all yours, sir. STARBUCK: Okay. TYROL: He likes the warm light. STARBUCK: Makes the touch easier, right? STARBUCK: Maybe, okay. [Whining.] This is stupid. STARBUCK: This is stupid. It's worth a try, sir. It did fly for you once. Hasn't made so much as a grunt since. TYROL: I don't know, take it for a ride. STARBUCK: Ride it. TYROL: Treat it like a horse. STARBUCK: Okay, a horse. Why not a goat? That's good, right? Think of it as a goat. Okay. Whatever. Come on, boy. Giddyup! [Engine starting.] Okay, you're kidding. Chief? TYROL: Don't shoot anything. ROSLIN: Doctor. Madam President. - I am so sorry. - Thank you. You are here to free me, right? To bring this travesty to a close because you know I'm innocent. Just tell me, so I understand because I want to understand why you did it. I didn't do it. It wasn't me. BALTAR: I'm being framed! ROSLIN: Why would she do that? Because she's a Cylon. She's a Cylon. - You are going to have to believe me. - I want to believe you. I want to believe that I haven't made such a profound error in judgment in trusting you and asking your advice. But here's where we are, Doctor. If anyone can be a Cylon, and it's hard to tell us apart then we only have one thing left to trust our instincts, feelings. And the moment they told me it was your face in the photo I knew I believed it. I believe you're involved in the attack. Somehow, I feel it. You'll forgive me, Madam President if I don't wish to be executed based solely on your gut feeling. May the gods have mercy on your soul. HELO: Call it. BOOMER: Heads. HELO: Heads. You win. You sleep. I watch. BOOMER: No. You're the one who needs sleep. I couldn't sleep if I had to listen to Tyrol read the flight manual. Okay. Truth is if something happened to you I wouldn't know how to deal with it. I feel the same way. [Thunder rumbling.] Back on the ship HELO: Look, I knew what was going on. I mean, between you and the Chief. I think everybody did. And I respected it. Your feelings, his. [Soft instrumental music.] But I would've given anything to be him. I'm not trying to put you on the spot here. I don't want to step on what you two have. HELO: You feel the way you feel and I have to respect it. [Thunder clapping.] [Rhythmic instrumental music.] BOOMER: No. It's not true. [Gasping and groaning.] [Rhythmic instrumental music continues.] [Solemn instrumental music.] I know we haven't spoke before. But I don't wish to offend. Please. BALTAR: Dear God I now acknowledge that you are the one true God. Deliver me from this evil and I will devote the rest of what is left of my wretched life to doing good. I don't know what to To carrying out your divine will is what I want to do. [Solemn instrumental music continues.] To carry out your divine will. Grant me grace and forgiveness. [No. 6 shushing.] I'm here now. I'm here. All will be well. It will be as God wants it to be. [Knocking on door.] GAETA: Open the door. Wait. I haven't even had a trial yet. No! Wait! It's a lie! - Doctor, it's all right. - It's a lie! GAETA: Photograph was a fake. BALTAR: What? It was almost seamless, but your face, the man, the reflection, it was all a fake. BALTAR: Of course it was a fake. I don't wear a shirt like that. BALTAR: How did you GAETA: I went back, re-ran security checks. This time I found markers which pointed to photo manipulation. They weren't apparent until the photo was fully resolved. You re-ran the security checks? Thank you. I just knew that you could never have anything to do with that attack. GAETA: You're not that kind of man. It was really nothing. Once the photos were fully resolved it was almost too easy, like she wanted to be found out. ADAMA: How did she get off? TIGH: Got me. - There's been no ships. - I gave you an order. I had two Marines tailing her. They say they went around a corner and she was gone. Every ship in the fleet has reported in, sir. No sign of her. That's unacceptable. She was here. She was right here. This woman existed. She didn't just vanish. Have them check again. - Every ship? - Every ship, including this one. [Tense instrumental music.] She didn't just vanish. ROSLIN: that he had been a victim of treachery and deceit. Clearly, the Cylons wanted to discredit Doctor Baltar because of his work on the Cylon detector. Doctor Baltar, it gives me great pleasure to exonerate you publicly and to recognise you, once again, among us as a scientist, a leader, and a friend. [All applauding.] NO. 6: You're a hero. You're even more popular and powerful than ever before. You've had your trial by fire, so now they truly believe in you. Hard for anyone to accuse you of treason again. [Tense instrumental music continues.] Was that the plan all along? Build me up in the public eye by first tearing me down? Right. Who am I to question the plans of Almighty God? BALTAR: Just one, small, practical question. Shelly? Shelly Godfrey? Was there ever a woman really called Shelly Godfrey? Did she ever actually exist? Was she ever really here? God's will be done. [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] Zak failed basic flight. But he didn't because I passed him. I can't decode it, but it means there's someone. Someone in the military is still alive and kicking here in Caprica. [Cheering.] I have cancer. And I fear that knowledge of my illness will erode hope. So this has to stay between you and me. - Zak was my brother. - What was he to me, nothing? Same old Lee. You haven't changed either. [Warning system beeping.] [Coughs.] [Spacecraft engine droning.] Helmet! - You are so unprepared. - Shut up! [Laughs.] You're the worst CAG in the history of CAGs actually. DUALLA: Raptor pilot Lt. Dwight Flat-top Sanders entering hangar Deck 12 B. Deck hands, please report. DUALLA: Repeat, deck hands, please report to 12 B. PILOT 1: There he is! PILOT 2: Way to go, Lieutenant! [Pilots cheering.] PILOT 1: Raptor Pilots flying high! PILOTS: Raptor Pilots flying high! - Red paint, incoming! - Brush? You're the worst. The absolute worst! Here. PILOT 1: Raptor Pilots flying by! PILOTS: Raptor Pilots flying by! What the hell is this? Flat-top's 1,000th landing and nobody tells me. Now we look like idiots. TYROL: Find a wagon! DECK HAND: Yes, sir! Somebody get me a wagon! One, zero, zero. ADAMA: You're not ready yet? [Laughing.] Someone's going to have to pick that up. [Giggling.] - Stop it! - Let's go, come on. This one is perfect. Take this. Here, give me a hand. Unload this. Put it wherever. You two, come here. Take this wagon to the palace. [Pilots singing and cheering.] STARBUCK: Did the Commander tell you what happened on his 1,000th landing? - I don't remember telling you what I did. - Whatever. STARBUCK: He's landing on the Atlantia and he's been having this ongoing fight with the LSO and so he decides he'll stick it to him good. This has all been over-exaggerated. PILOTS: Come on, people, watch them bake PILOT 1: Three Little Cylons in the air PILOTS: Three Little Cylons in the air. PILOT 1: Watch their metal burn and flare! So, he skids to a stop on the flight deck and the LSO hears over the wire there's this big, loud, long, obnoxious [Farting noise.] [Laughing.] ADAMA: I was young. STARBUCK: It was great. It was really funny. PILOT 1: Two Little Cylons jump in their cave PILOT 1: Come on A-CARS make their grave! The LSO is freaking out your dad doesn't care because he hates the guy. He figures he can get away with it 'cause it's his 1,000th landing. "I can get away with anything today!" PILOTS: Watch that tin can hit the spot! [Dramatic instrumental music.] PILOT 1: Five Little Cylons in the grass PILOTS: Watch the Raptor light their ass! [Explosion.] DUALLA: Attention! Fire on the port hangar deck. DUALLA: Away the fire and rescue team ADAMA: Let's go! [Theme music.] [Struggles and pants.] [Warning system beeping.] Metal fatigue, old equipment. Worn strap fails, drops a million cubic drone to the deck. Kills 13 pilots and lands seven more in sick bay. HADRIAN: It's hard to hear this, but we got lucky. If that had been a missile instead of a cone drone it could've taken out the side of the ship. Never had a death in my hangar deck. Accidents. Never a death. Services for the dead. APOLLO: Services will commence at 1100 hours on the forward hangar deck. Mid-ship's hangar deck remains closed for investigation and clean up until further notice. Uniforms for the services will be dress greys. I wish I knew what to say, words to make this better. Can anything make this better? I don't know. ADAMA: Attention on deck! ADAMA: As you were. ADAMA: May I? APOLLO: Yes, sir. [Eerie instrumental music.] Are you Lt. Thrace? Give me your eyes. I know this has been a hard day. ADAMA: There's been plenty of them lately. I can guarantee you there'll be more to come. ADAMA: Remember your self-esteem. Your self-respect. And your self-worth. Hold strong to them, because people are watching. You're the guardians of the fleet. They need to know that they can count on you. ADAMA: Even at a time like this. ADAMA: Are you Lt. Thrace? I'm Cdr. Adama. Zak's father. I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir. I was planning on coming to see you tomorrow before the funeral. You don't need to explain anything. GUARD: Present arms! GUARD: Order arms! Once again, we are charged with the solemn duty to return the bodies of our own to the universe from which the Lords of Kobol brought them to us. CLERIC: The burdens of this life are with us but a short time. For Lt. Zak Adama, son of William and Caroline Adama brother of Lee, the time was too short. CLERIC: But we take comfort in knowing his life was willingly given in service to all of us. CLERIC: We honour them for that. CLERIC: And, thus, it falls upon us to repent our sins and with the help of the Lords of Kobol make our own lives worthy of that gift. CLERIC: And now, we commit his body to the ground from which we were all made. ELOSHA: Secure in the knowledge that we will be reunited with them in a better world to come. [Melancholic instrumental music.] So say we all. So say we all. [Snare drums sounding military drumbeat.] GUARD: Present arms! [Gunshot.] [Gunshot.] [Gunshot.] ADAMA: Pilots we've known. ADAMA: I have to start training new pilots. [Starbuck chuckles.] There it is. [Clears throat.] I kind of thought this was about that. I don't know if I'm the right person for this. - Do you know someone better? - No. But there's almost 50,000 people out there. Trying to tell me there's not one flight instructor? There's two. Civilians. Both. ADAMA: But I need someone to teach combat tactics. You know, I don't know if I'd be of any use to you. - I wasn't the most patient. - Let's get down to it. This is about Zak. It was not your fault. You had nothing to do with what happened. It was an accident. Lee? Zak failed basic flight. - What? - Or at least he should have, but he didn't because I passed him. His technique was sloppy and he had no feel for flying but I passed him. Because he and I Because I felt something and I let it get in the way of doing my job. STARBUCK: And I couldn't fail him. Zak passed basic flight. ADAMA: He was trained and ready to sit in that cockpit. What happened to him could've happened to any qualified pilot. - You know that's true. - Right. You did your job to the best of your ability. That's all I can ask. I need new pilots. And I want you to train them. I can do that. [Sighs.] Just give them the attention and the professionalism that you gave my son. And they'll be one hell of a squadron. Ten cubits says she takes him this time. You're on. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Ten to stay. So, Gaeta, how are you and the Doc here doing on your Cylon detector? What Cylon detector? CRASHDOWN: Rumour has it that Cylons look like people and you guys are working on a way to weed them out, right? ZAK: I want you to tell me the truth about something. STARBUCK: You passed. By the skin of your teeth, but you passed. ZAK: I don't want any special treatment. Not from my father and certainly not from you. GAETA: If there were such a programme, it would be classified and I wouldn't be able to talk about it. BALTAR: Something smells horrible in here. Is that you, Crashdown? CRASHDOWN: Yeah, that's me. BALTAR: Your card. BALTAR: Your card. Zak, I'm a flight instructor. I'm not going to send you to Vipers if I don't think you got the chops. Okay? Hello? Are you all right? BALTAR: Look [Pants.] Maybe you'd like to take a break? [Clears throat.] I'm out of here. Starbuck? CRASHDOWN: Okay, she can't do that. BOOMER: She can and she did. [Mysterious instrumental music.] BOOMER: This is it. HELO: Restaurant. BOOMER: I'm almost on top of the signal. I don't get it. How does a military coded signal end up coming from in here? Let's find out. Nothing. Is that thing working? BOOMER: I checked it three times. BOOMER: This thing says we're right on top of it. HELO: Of what? What? BOOMER: Helo. HELO: You're frackking kidding me. [Helo laughs.] HELO: Food. Medical supplies. [Helo yelps.] HELO: Wait a minute, the signal. [Beeping.] BOOMER: Disaster beacon. It's been set to go off if there was an attack. Some poor slob goes to all the trouble of building a fallout shelter, stocks it has a beacon, the whole planet Then what? What happens to him? Let's just call ourselves lucky and leave it at that. [Eerie instrumental music.] - Madame President. - Would you close that curtain, please? ROSLIN: Thank you. You are obviously an intelligent, well-educated young woman. Would you mind explaining to me why you waited five years in between breast exams? Yes, I would mind. It's none of your business. I was busy. - And now, here you are. - Yes. Here we are. - Would you mind? - I do, actually. Your doctor back on Caprica was right. It's too damn late to operate, the cancer is too far advanced. DOC COTTLE: We can try to shrink the tumour with gamma treatments and follow that up with IV cis-Doloxan. Did he explain to you the side-effects of Doloxan? Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration. I watched my mother endure two years of Doloxan before she died. I would like to explore alternate treatment. DOC COTTLE: Prayer? ROSLIN: Witty. Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract? DOC COTTLE: Gods. You're one of those. ROSLIN: What if it works? All the evidence on Chamalla is anecdotal. DOC COTTLE: It's nothing but a bunch of loose talk and false hope. ROSLIN: I'll take that as a yes. All right. I'll put out a med request to the civilian fleet. Maybe there's some other wide-eyed dreamer out there with a secret horde of Chamalla extract in their luggage. DOC COTTLE: Put your clothes back on now. ROSLIN: Thank you. DOC COTTLE: And for what it's worth I would seriously consider prayer. Boonie jumpers. Shuttle jockies. And a Fleet Academy wash-out. This is the best that you could come up with? - Diamonds in the rough. - Yeah, right. APOLLO: They're the most qualified pilots in the fleet. STARBUCK: Great! STARBUCK: Attention on deck. That means get on your feet, nuggets! You are joining the Colonial Fleet, boys and girls, not some after-school club. Seats. STARBUCK: Pilots call me Starbuck, but you may refer to me as God. You've all flown before, but you're about to enter a whole new world so pay attention. We don't have any flight simulators on board so we're putting you into the cockpit, today. This is the Viper Mark II. It's as manoeuvrable as a jack-rabbit, and can flip end for end in 0.35 seconds. You've never flown anything remotely like it, so don't think that you have. STARBUCK: Today we'll do basic launch, approach, and landing manoeuvres and anyone not paying attention is liable to end up as a puddle or something to be hosed out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck. She's laying it on a little thick. STARBUCK: Costanza, right? COSTANZA: Yes, God, sir. Not anymore. From now on, your name is "Hot Dog." And when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen. Maybe if you had learned that at the Academy, you wouldn't have washed out. Sit up! LSO: Viper 791 Galactica, you are cleared for approach. LSO: Speed 175 port bay, hands on approach checkers green. Call the ball. I have the ball. STARBUCK: Easy on the throttle, Kat. STARBUCK: Are you listening to me? Don't chase the lights, okay? KAT: Roger, Starbuck. STARBUCK: Kat, don't chase the lights! Set it by the numbers and correct with thrusters. LSO: Wave-off! Punch it, Kat! Worse than awful. Wretched beyond belief, actually. STARBUCK: You call yourselves pilots. It'll take the knuckle draggers a week to pound your divots out of the flight deck. - With due respect, sir, that's unfair. - Yes, sir. This was only our first day. No. It's your last. It would be criminal to let any of you near a Viper again. So pack your gear and get the hell off my ship. You're done. What are you doing here, Kara? - You can't wash them out on their first day. - I just did. Look, I got 40 Vipers, and 21 pilots. That's it. We are sitting ducks until we finish water-op's. We can't even maintain a CAP. And Gods forbid the Cylons show up. Gods forbid. Let's bring in the next group of candidates. The next group has never even been in a cockpit. - They're starting basic flight. - Then they start basic flight. Because that group is done. It says so right there. Maybe you should read it again. APOLLO: Lt. Thrace, this is not a request. STARBUCK: Well, Capt. Adama! I am the flight instructor, sir. My word is scripture, sir. STARBUCK: I will not, repeat, not pass another student who isn't ready. So, that's what this is about. It's not them. It's Zak. Careful. Step back. [Pants and grunts.] [Grunts.] ADAMA: Starbuck says they can't cut it, they can't cut it. She's not giving them a chance. It's Day 1. She's one of the finest pilots I've ever seen in my life. One day in the cockpit is all she needs to know if they can hack it or not. ADAMA: She got that. APOLLO: I'm not arguing that, sir. I'm just saying that I think she's letting her personal feelings cloud her judgment. Please sit down, Captain. ADAMA: What are those feelings? About Zak. - We've talked about, Zak. - You did? ADAMA: We've talked about a lot of things. We've been aboard this ship for over two years. We know each other very well. When I asked her to be the instructor I knew it was going to release a lot of loose baggage. She acknowledged it. She's a professional. She'll do her job. Okay. I'm just saying that you should talk to her. APOLLO: She's walking around with a lot of emotion. She almost decked me in the rec room. Right. You wouldn't smile if you were there. - I'll talk to her. - Thank you. Personally I think she's trying to work out her guilt over what she did for Zak. I think she's making up for it by beating up on these guys. Guilt? Over what? What did she do for Zak? - I thought you just said - What did she do? It's not my place to say and I've already said more than I should have. - You'll have to ask her. I'm sorry. - Captain, just Dad, you'll have to ask her. ZAK: I don't want any special treatment. Not from my father, and certainly not from you. You passed. By the skin of your teeth, but you passed. DUALLA: Attention. Pass the word to Lt. Thrace. Lt. Thrace, please report to the CO's quarters. Yes. Come in. ADAMA: Lee was just here before. STARBUCK: I knew it. He thinks you washed out the nuggets without giving them a chance. They didn't cut it. That's it. He thought you were letting personal feelings cloud your judgment. STARBUCK: Really? ADAMA: Your feelings about Zak. That's not the case. Okay. ADAMA: He said something else. He said something that I would like to ask you directly. ADAMA: He said that you might be feeling guilty about something that you did for Zak. What did you do for him? STARBUCK: I don't know. Ask Lee. ADAMA: I'm asking you. I don't know I don't really know what he was talking about, so Don't fence with me, Kara. I love you like a daughter. I don't deserve that. Zak failed basic flight. He wasn't a bad pilot. He just had no feel for flying. And when it came to his final check-ride, he busted three of the test manoeuvres. And I should have flunked him, but I didn't. The bottom line is that your son didn't have the chops to fly a Viper. And it killed him. ADAMA: He told me that you were an amazing instructor. And that he was involved with you, and that it was serious. He asked me to come to his graduation from flight school - to watch him get his wings. - I know. I read the letter. I see. Then, maybe you can tell me what he was hinting at. Surprise, about you. We were going to You know what, it's not important. - I don't want that to - You were engaged, right? You did it because you were engaged. [Sombre instrumental music.] Because I made a mistake. And because I was just I was so in love with him. And I let that get in the way of doing my job. He just wanted it so much and I didn't want to be the one who crushed him. Reinstate the trainees to flight status. I will. - I just want you to understand that I - Do your job. Yes, sir. And walk out of this cabin while you still can. [Starbuck clears her throat.] Unpack your gear. You are all returned to flight status. We're going to try this again. Those of you who can be trained to safely fly the Viper Mark II will pass. Those of you who cannot, will be cut. STARBUCK: It's my job to figure out which is which, without personal feeling either way. And I'm going to do my job. Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog, you're up first. Pre-flight briefing in 20 minutes. CHUCKLES: Where the hell are you going, Hot Dog? Stay on me. HOT DOG: Target acquired and destroyed. Not bad, Hot Dog, but you left your leader behind. KAT: Looks like you're having a bad day, Hot Dog. - And the moral of this story is? - Never leave your leader. Thank you. That is correct. You never want to be out here alone. STARBUCK: Okay, Chuckles, take Kat's wing. Hot Dog, you're on me. We'll try a little manoeuvre called "Thorch Weave." I'll be damned. What's got into Starbuck? TIGH: She actually sounds like a real instructor for a change. TIGH: She may actually make Viper pilots out of some of those nuggets after all. STARBUCK: Holy crap, we've got incoming. TIGH: Where the hell did they come from? Dradis. Multiple contacts. GAETA: It's the Cylons. TIGH: Why didn't we see them coming? Launch the alert fighters. Attention! Set Condition 1 throughout the fleet. Galactica, send the Calvary. Nuggets, punch it for home. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] ADAMA: Where's the base ship? GAETA: No base ships detected, sir. GAETA: Eight raiders, bearing 047 carom 118. Range 22,000. They found us. It was only a matter of time. Galactica, Starbuck. Where the hell are the alert fighters? ALERT ONE: Starbuck, Alert One. Be there in two minutes. The Cylons are gaining! All right, listen up, nuggets. Stay together and keep your throttles firewalled until you hit the deck. STARBUCK: Now, go. ADAMA: What's she doing? TIGH: Starbuck's gonna take on all eight. And get herself killed. KAT: Hot Dog, where are you going? STARBUCK: Hot Dog, what are you doing? HOT DOG: Got one! STARBUCK: Hot Dog! Get out of here! STARBUCK: Hot Dog, I told you to get your ass home! HOT DOG: You said never to leave your leader. STARBUCK: I also said never to disobey an order. - I'm hit! - I got you, Hot Dog! We're going to make it through this. Break right. Now! [Thrilling instrumental music.] She'll make it. I just lost all three mains. It's all right, Hot Dog. You did good. We're gonna be okay, I promise you. At least one of us will. STARBUCK: That about does it. I think there's only one left. Frack! STARBUCK: He's right on my tail, but I got it covered. Starbuck's wireless and transponder just cut out. ALERT ONE: Alert One, we spotted Hot Dog. No ID or visual on Starbuck. [Chuckles.] Frack me! [Struggles and pants.] [Theme music.]





                    			NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica. [Dramatic instrumental music.] COTTLE: Your doctor back on Caprica was right. It's too damn late to operate, the cancer is too far advanced. Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract? It means that you're still acting like you're everyone's best friend. We're not friends, you're the CAG. The Chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed. But, clearly, you still need the rest. Take your time. No rush. I need new pilots. And I want you to train them. I can do that. They slipped through. How's that possible? NO. 6: She thinks she loves him. Now that she can't live without him. - Bothers you, doesn't it? - We'll get them in the end. I can assure you that fuel shortage is our number one priority. Galactica has ships scouring the nearby star systems and we can anticipate that they will soon find tylium. Hamilton? Madam President, tylium ore is extremely rare. If we don't find any, how long before the fleet runs out of fuel? That all depends on how well we conserve. Isn't it a fact, Ma'am President, that we only have enough for two more jumps? Yes. That is correct. Do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium? [Reporters murmuring questioningly.] [lntense instrumental music.] We would If that were to happen we would use our last fuel to jump to the nearest planetary system. And pray we're lucky enough to find a habitable planet. Madam President, without fuel to take even the most basic evasive manoeuvres No REPORTER 1:wouldn't we be like ducks in a Cylon shooting gallery? Yes, we would. [Snake hissing fiercely.] ROSLIN: I'm I'm sorry. That is all for now. [lntense instrumental music intensifies.] [Reporters murmuring quizzically.] REPORTER 2: She did not do this. CRASHDOWN: [On radio.] Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field. BOOMER: Any luck? [Sighing.] How many times are you gonna ask me that, Boomer? Well, until you find some tylium ore. Don't you want to be a hero to Ensign Davis? [Exclaims in exasperation.] You haven't noticed how she always sits next to you in the mess? [Mimicking Davis.] "How's it going, Crash? You look so cute." Damn it. There's so much debris in this system, the dradis is useless. This is going to take 100 years. BOOMER: I heard about how you found water, how you saved the whole place [Computer beeping.] [Exclaiming incredulously.] Jackpot, Boomer. That asteroid dead ahead is a mountain of tylium. [Exclaiming excitedly.] CRASHDOWN: Check it. Thank the Gods! We're heroes. Yeah. "We're heroes." It never fails. Great, the second that I score, the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit. - Okay, so who's the one that we suggest - What? Cylons. [Tense instrumental music.] The rock's crawling with them. We are well and truly fracked. Only tylium within 12 light years and we've got to kiss it goodbye. Yeah, along with our asses if we don't get out of here fast. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] [Theme music.] TIGH: It figures the Cylons would be sitting on the only source of fuel within our reach. Still staking out every waterhole in the desert. Only this time it's a lake, enough tylium to last us a couple of years. APOLLO: This must be some kind of conveyor belt to get the ore from the mine here into this cracking plant here. GAETA: A refinery this far from their home world? APOLLO: Why not? They need fuel as much as we do. GAETA: Now they've got it. And enough firepower to keep it. APOLLO: All right. So we forget this asteroid, find another source. You can bet your ass the Cylons will be guarding that one, too. We send the Raptors out farther. Find a source they haven't reached yet. TIGH: We'll use up all our fuel doing it. How're we going to get our refinery ship We take the tylium from the Cylons. [Tense instrumental music.] With all respect, this is hardly a time to attack a superior force. This is exactly the time. We know where they are. They don't know where we are. We'll catch them with their pants down. If we fail? End of game. So we don't fail. STARBUCK: When the missile gets close enough you'll be pulling maybe 7 G's. But to catch you, the bastard's gonna have to pile on 40 to 60. Its guidance system can't hack it, and it'll miss most of the time. Exactly how often is "most of the time"? It depends on your judgment, and how well you pray. Attention on deck. ADAMA: As you were. Lt. Thrace, can I have a word? STARBUCK: Of course. Take five, guys. STARBUCK: What's up? ADAMA: How are they doing? Wobbly as newborn colts, but they're getting stronger. That's good. Got a job for you. Rumour mill has it that you're planning an op. Rumour mill's right for a change. Capt. Adama and Col. Tigh are working up the plan now and I need some serious out-of-the-box thinking. Out-of-the-box is where I live. I've been taking Chamalla for a medical condition. So what have you seen? It started out as dreams of the Cylon that we had executed. But I had the dreams before we captured him. - The images were - Prescient? ROSLIN: Uncanny. And now I'm seeing things while I'm awake. - What kind of things? - Snakes. There were snakes crawling all over my podium during a press conference. - How many? - About a dozen. [Slow instrumental music.] You're kidding, right? You read Pythia, and now you're having me on. No. - Who is Pythia? - One of the oracles in the sacred scrolls. Pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of the human race. And the Lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland. And unto the leader they gave a vision of serpents, numbering two and ten as a sign of things to come. Pythia wrote that? She also wrote that the new leader suffered a wasting disease and would not live to enter the new land. But you're not dying. Are you? APOLLO: And that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installations here. Now, if we do it right, there won't be any Cylon survivors. APOLLO: And the asteroid will be ours. ADAMA: What do you think, Starbuck? It's a textbook perfect plan, which is why it won't work. TIGH: Of course. We bow to your vast experience in strategic planning. Refresh my memory. What year was it that you graduated from war college? What's the matter, married life not all you expected? Enough. Both of you. We're not going to win this one by the book. I want Starbuck in here because she's not weighed down by conventional thinking. All due respect, gentlemen, we're not as crazy as she is. Okay. So what would you do differently? To start jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid to hide it from the Cylon base is an obvious move. You think they'll be covering that blind spot with recon patrols? I would, if I were them. What we need to do is make their patrols part of our plan, you know? Make their tactics work for us. Here's what I would do: [Rhythmic drumbeat.] At position code Deacon we'll need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys. Which means those passengers will have to be relocated to other ships which are already overcrowded. Yes, if you approve. STARBUCK: The decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid. Galactica will jump here close enough to launch its Vipers at the base. Soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system, they'll break wireless silence. They'll be posing as a mining fleet coming after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence. STARBUCK: The Cylons will hear the messages and send a force of Raiders after them. This will leave the base relatively undefended. We'll have Raptors pre-positioned to keep an eye on the Cylons. STARBUCK: When the Cylons move toward the decoys Galactica's Vipers will come in from behind, and obliterate the base. APOLLO: Without the base, they'll be unable to rearm, refuel. We'll mop them up, and then we'll take the tylium. What happens to the crews on the civilian decoy ships? They'll keep their FTL drives spooled up, and jump clear the first sign of trouble. How many casualties do you anticipate? lt'll cost us. [Rhythmic drumbeat continues.] If you succeed, what's to prevent the Cylons from coming back with reinforcements? ADAMA: Nothing. ADAMA: But if we get a chance to knock out that base it will buy us some time. ROSLIN: Why? If you keep running from the schoolyard bully he keeps on chasing you. But when you turn around and stop and you punch him really hard in a sensitive spot he'll think twice about coming back again. So it's either this, or run out of fuel and be annihilated. Sometimes you have to roll the hard six. Well, the freighters are yours. Good hunting, everyone. ADAMA: Operation starts in 48 hours. TIGH: This is our target. BALTAR: A Cylon base? And you're the Cylon expert. TIGH: We need to destroy their military facilities. Without harming the tylium ore under the surface. TIGH: Exactly. A nuke would destroy the Cylons. But the radiation would render the ore inert, unusable. I see your dilemma. Well, you're in luck, you know. BALTAR: Refined tylium contains tremendous enthalpy to the order of half a billion mega joules per kilo. Subjected to right heat and compression, say, from a conventional warhead you should get a suitably devastating explosion without the radioactive fallout. All we have to do is hit the right spot. Specifically, you must hit the staging tanks for the refined tylium precursor. It's a lot more unstable than the fuel itself. And where would they be? [Dramatic instrumental music.] I need your advice on this one. I'm flattered, Gaius but I don't know the first thing about tylium refineries. Neither do I. Oh, come on, you must have an inkling - where I should tell them to bomb? - No. NO. 6: But God does. BALTAR: Oh, good. I suppose God doesn't want me to destroy the base because he's the Cylon God. Right? God doesn't take sides. He only wants your love. NO. 6: Open your heart to him, and he'll show you the way. It'd be a lot simpler if he came out and told me. You must remember to surrender your ego. Remain humble. BALTAR: If you ask me God could do with cleaning his ears out. Then he'd hear what I have to say. - Relax your neck. - Why? What are you going to do? NO. 6: I said relax. BALTAR: All right, but please don't STARBUCK: Where would the staging tanks be, Doctor? [Exclaiming dreamily.] There. Right there. BALTAR: Hit any one of them and the place will go up like a three kiloton bomb. [Ominous instrumental music.] Well done. Forceful, so decisive, delivered with such élan. He didn't speak to me. God didn't speak to me. I was totally lying. I just picked that spot at random. He doesn't always speak in words, Gaius. So the fate of the entire human race depends upon my wild guess. TRAINER: Attention on deck. ADAMA: As you were. How's the knee, Starbuck? lt'll be ready. I'm not missing this party. [Exhaling deeply.] Apollo's leading the strike force. You'll have to sit this one out. - I'm the best pilot that you have. - Not right now. In combat, you got to pull 6, 7 G's. Doc says your knee won't take it. - Well, then he's wrong. - Is he? A Viper thruster pedal requires this much force to activate. [Grunting.] Now you're on your attack run. They launch their missiles so you've got to jam that pedal into the firewall and hold a 6 G turn for 10 seconds or you die. [Tense instrumental music.] ADAMA: 10, 9, 8 [Starbuck gasping in pain.] This is only 3 G's, Starbuck. Not 6. I'm sorry. It's a tough one. But you're staying home. STARBUCK: Keep your ingress low and fast. Use the terrain to stay hidden till the last second. Make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time so they can weaken defences. APOLLO: You don't think I'm up to this? STARBUCK: Of course I do. You'll be fine. Look, you're worried that I'm not gonna pull it out of the fire with some high-risk retina-detaching move the way Starbuck would. Look, Kara, I'm sorry you're not suiting up. 'Cause everyone would feel so much better, me included if you were riding along with us. But this isn't an ego trip. This is my job. And don't think for one moment that I will not get it done. I hope so. Because we've got one shot. Don't frack it up by over-thinking. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] HELO: Nice thing about being on the run after a nuclear war nobody left to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry while you're on your way to steal a ship, and get off the planet. - It's odd, isn't it? - What? That we haven't seen a single living human being since the one you shot when you rescued me. We're still alive. Why nobody else? BOOMER: Probably holed up in the fallout shelters or something. Two ways out and a lovely view. What could be better? A feather bed with a silk comforter. HELO: You hungry? BOOMER: I don't know. What do we got? HELO: Peanut butter baked beans, corn How about some chilli? [Boomer vomiting.] A simple "no" would do. Sharon, have you been taking your anti-radiation meds? I think it was those cold beans we had this afternoon. - You okay now? - Yeah. How far you figure to Delphi? Eight, maybe ten days if we move fast. If we start early, we can be there in no time. [Sombre instrumental music.] Can't sleep? I couldn't either before a big op. The Mark II. Good ship. ADAMA: Got me out of a lot of tough scrapes. ADAMA: I've got something for you. It belonged to your grandfather. ADAMA: My mum bought it for him when he was in law school. [Sentimental instrumental music.] You see the engraving on it? Yeah, I can barely make it out, but He was a better father than I was. Dad used to carry that into court cases. Claimed he never lost unless he left it behind. So you're worried, too? About what? You know, sometimes it feels like the whole ship thinks Starbuck would do better. I don't. How can you be so sure? Because you're my son. [Sentimental instrumental music swells.] ADAMA: Get some rest. You're going to need it. Dad I'll bring it back. You'd better, or I'll kick your ass. It's a good lighter. [Exhaling deeply.] [Thunder rumbling.] Sharon. Wake up. HELO: What the frack! You killed her BOOMER: Let me see. [Footsteps pounding.] We gotta go. Right now. Wait a minute. I saw her on my lap. I saw her blood spill on my lap. Let's move, mister. [Dramatic instrumental music.] - What the hell is going on? - I don't know. We'll figure it out later. Jump complete, sir. Dradis reports nothing but hash. Just as we expected. Can't see a thing. We are now within launch range of the Cylon base. OFFICER 1: [On radio.]  Constellation jump complete on station, point Deacon. Initiate search pattern, Delta. OFFICER 2: [On radio.] Ore flight Bravo. Delta, Wilco. OFFICER 3: Ore flight Nebula, Delta initiated. The ball's in play. You can bet they heard that. Now they'll try to locate the decoys. And when they do? If they take the bait, all hell breaks loose. - Until then? - We wait. BOOMER: Galactica, Boomer. Tally, 90 plus, headed Deacon. [On radio.] Speed, 250. [Ships whizzing.] APOLLO: [On radio.] The Cylons have seen the freighter. They're en route to intercept it. They took the bait. - Mr. Gaeta, launch Strike Force 1. - Aye, sir. D, launch strike force one. Attention. Pilots, man your planes. [On PA system.] Pilots, man your planes. [Alarm sounding.] [Tense instrumental music.] - How hard did they bite? - Boomer's report said 90 plus. They've launched most of their fighter force. [Tense instrumental music.] LAUNCH OFFICER: Give them hell, sir. Firing. [Gripping instrumental music.] Attack forces away. I just hope that Lee can Lee isn't the problem. You should take a good look at yourself. I had to go through the same transition. When you're in the cockpit, you're in control. It's hard to give it up. It would just be a lot easier if I was flying with them. All you can do now is wait, and hope you didn't make any mistakes. I never wanted this kind of responsibility. The Cylons never asked us what we wanted. Welcome to the big leagues. [Sober instrumental music.] CRASHDOWN: [On radio.] Galactica, Crashdown. Tally, 50 plus on an intercept course. Repeat. 50 plus inbound. What's that mean? It means that a Cylon patrol spotted our attack force. The base sent out 50 more Raiders to intercept. Fifty Raiders? That means we're outnumbered now 5-to-1? Weren't the decoys supposed to take care of that? - The Cylons were too smart for that. - Frack. Estimated time to strike intercept, 2 minutes. [Tense instrumental music.] FIREBALL: Fireball multiple bandits, left 10 high, range 40. Weapons free. Committing. [Weapons firing.] Hot Dog, visual tally, press. Hot Dog, break right. [Explosions.] [Firing continues.] Fireball, your six. [Alarm beeping.] I'm hit. Man eject. FIREBALL: [On radio.] Stop! BUZZER: Deadbolt, Spinner. Two bandits closing your right side. SPINNER: No joy! [Loud explosion.] [Spinner screaming.] [Ship whizzing.] HOT DOG: [On radio.] Galactica, Hot Dog. Heavily engaged. Mission outcome doubtful. - This sounds fracking awful. - They're getting cut to pieces out there. BUZZER: Get out of there! Move! BUZZER: [On radio.] Deadbolt, right vertical, now! DEADBOLT: Diamond, get a shot. Get him off me. Mr. Gaeta, abort Strike 1. DUALLA: Strike One, Galactica. Return to base. Repeat. Abort your mission, and return to base. [Tense instrumental music.] STUBB: [On radio.] Galactica, Stubb. Cylon strike force is turning away from Deacon and inbound to Galactica. OPERATOR: Noting Raiders inbound. The Cylons heard our transmission recall, didn't they? Does that mean the first wave of Raiders is ignoring the decoys, and is coming after us? That's exactly what it means. [Tense instrumental music intensifies.] BALTAR: So, when are we going to launch the reserve Vipers to defend Galactica? There are no reserve Vipers. Everything is on the board already. Now we play for all the marbles. Starbuck, it's your plan. Mr. Gaeta will you please tell D to get on the scrambler and inform Apollo the back door is open? Aye, Lieutenant. GAETA: D, please send a scrambler to Capt. Apollo. Message reads, "The back door is open." Apollo, Galactica. Back door is open. Godspeed, Apollo. [lntense instrumental music.] [Ship humming.] [lntense instrumental music swells.] Lt. Thrace, why didn't you tell me we had another attack force hidden in the freighters? STARBUCK: We ADAMA: It was my decision. I routinely restrict tactical details to those who need to know. Old habits die hard. So you still might pull this off? ADAMA: If Dr. Baltar's target information is correct. And whether we get blown to pieces by those Cylon Raiders heading toward us right now. Speaking of which, I'm needed in CIC. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Electronic beeping.] Initial point in 5 seconds. Flak suppression unit cleared hot. APOLLO: [On radio.] Okay, let's do this. Come on, Lee. It's all on you. [Tense instrumental music.] Incoming! [Gripping instrumental music.] APOLLO: [On radio.] Weapons free. By the numbers, people. Target acquired. Tone and lock. KAT: [On radio.] Firing. Tone and lock. Firing. What's got into these fracking missiles? Come on. They're jamming the guidance systems. APOLLO: Strike two, Apollo. Then we get close enough so we don't need the guidance systems. APOLLO: We'll have to blow this thing manually. Wilco, Apollo. Rolling in. [Gripping instrumental music continues.] Chuckles! [Alarm blaring.] Oh, frack. Chuckles bought it. He's going down! [Stepchild screaming.] KAT: [On radio.] Now they've got our attack axis zeroed in. There's no way to fracking get close. There's gotta be. APOLLO: We've got to get out of this flak. Let's get down below deck, down where the target is. I've got an idea. I'm gonna take a closer look. [Dramatic instrumental music.] Commander on deck. ADAMA: As you were. The first wave of Cylons will be on us in three minutes. Notify the Strike 1 Vipers that they can stop running and blast those bastards to hell. DUALLA: Yes, sir. PILOT 1: Attacking Cylon fighters. PILOT 2: Target acquired, tone and lock. [Climactic instrumental music.] Oh, no, don't do this, Lee. The conveyor tunnel's clear. I'm going through it. You're out of your fracking mind, Apollo. What's going on? GAETA: Captain Apollo's flying into the conveyor tunnel hoping it will lead him to the refinery. BALTAR: Has he gone raving mad? There's no way to ensure it does anything of the kind. [Dramatic instrumental music.] Come on, keep it together, Lee. Oh, lords. [Apollo grunts.] [Thunderous roaring.] APOLLO: Okay, I'm through the tunnel. They can't get a firing solution on me. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] APOLLO: There you are. [Chanting.] Okay. I've got you. I've got you. [Fast-paced instrumental music.] [Exclaims in disbelie.] Galactica, Apollo. APOLLO: [On radio.] Mission accomplished. Yes. [Starbuck whoops.] [All cheering excitedly.] [Pounding instrumental music.] You can tell Dr. Baltar he was right on the money. It's one hell of a fireworks show. And there's plenty more for us back in the canyon once this place is history. [Cheering continues.] GAETA: Congratulations, Doctor, it worked. It did. [Heroic instrumental music.] It worked. I'm sorry, Madam President, I'm sorry. No need to apologise. Thanks to you, we have enough fuel to last us a few years. [Both chuckling in relie.] DUALLA: Commander, Strike 1 reports inbound Cylons are bugging out. Request permission to go after them, sir. - Tell our people to pursue and destroy them. - Affirmative. Strike 1, tear them up. [Heroic music.] [All cheering.] STARBUCK: Apollo, you magnificent bastard. That was one hell of a piece of flying and I couldn't have done it better myself. APOLLO: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. I said that I couldn't have done it better myself. Well, thank you. I had my doubts. So did I. I wasn't sure that crazy ass plan of yours would even possibly work. STARBUCK: You deserve this. DAVIS: Crash. [Crashdown exclaims in surprise.] [Starbuck laughs.] [Heroic music continues.] NO. 6: Have you read the Pythian Prophecy, Gaius? Not since the 6th grade. BALTAR: I can't say ancient history is my favourite subject. NO. 6: You should have paid closer attention. BALTAR: To what? "All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again." Everyone knows that verse. What are you getting at? [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Remember this one? "Led by serpents numbering two and ten." The Vipers, they're the serpents? There's a later verse, Gaius. You should read it. "Though the outcome favoured the few "it led to a confrontation at the home of the gods." [Ominous instrumental music.] Are you telling me that God guided my finger to that target for some arcane scriptural purpose? You are part of God's plan, Gaius. So God wanted me to destroy the Cylon base. You did well. You gave yourself over to Him. Yes, I suppose I did. There's really no other logical explanation for it. - I was - Am. [Ominous instrumental music continues.] I am an instrument of God. [Theme music.]
